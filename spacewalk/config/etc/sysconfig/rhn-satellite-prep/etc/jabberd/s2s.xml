      <!-- Maximum number of file descriptors. Note that the number of

         s2s itself can use some on its own. If the supply of file
         descriptors is exhausted, new incoming connections will be
         denied.

         These connections are mainly consumed when we make a
         connection to an external jabber server, or an external jabber
         server connects to us. If you don't have a lot of users then
         there's probably no need for s2s to establish connections to
         external jabber servers and the default value here is probably
         fine. On the other hand, if you have lots of users with lots
         of remote buddies in their buddylist then s2s will need to have
         lots of open connections with other jabber servers and you may
         need to increase this value.

         Note that this value only affects how many file descriptors
         jabberd is able to handle internally. You may also need to
         tell your operating system to allow jabberd to use more file
         descriptors. On Linux this can be done using ulimit -n or by
         changing the value of /proc/sys/fd/file-max.

    <!-- Queue expiry and connection timeout.

         While a connection is being established and dialback is in

         been established within this many seconds, the connection
         process will be aborted and the queued packets will be
         bounced. Timeout checks are made for three phases of
         setting up a route authenticated through dialback:
         1. Connection establishment to exchange of stream headers
         2. Initiating dialback (incoming connections)
         3. Completing dialback (incoming and outgoing)

         If stage 1 connection establishment fails and there are
         alternative hosts for this route that have not failed 
         recently, they will be tried too before finally giving up.
