         * The following isn't 100% accurate. All systems in the SSM are associated with
         * the operation, however only systems on which the package already exists (since
         * this is an upgrade) will actually have events scheduled.
         *
         * The problem is that the list of servers to which the package upgrades apply is
         * never stored in an RhnSet, which is used to make the impact of this call
         * minimal. The correct list is showed to the user before selecting confirm, so
         * the only potential issue is in viewing the SSM task log after the user has
         * confirmed the operation. Again, the events themselves are correctly scheduled
         * on only the systems to which they apply.
         *
         * For now, this small potential for logging inaccuracy is acceptable given the
         * proxmity of this fix to the Satellite 5.3 release (as opposed to omitting the
         * server association to the task entirely).
