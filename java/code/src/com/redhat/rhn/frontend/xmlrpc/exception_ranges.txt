When creating new xmlrpc exceptions, please attempt to find a free code
within the ranges below. If space in a range is exhausted, create a new one
elsewhere, likewise if your new exception doesn't fit in any of the
categories.

NOTE: Some older exceptions do not fit within these ranges, but were left as
is for backward compatability.
