Dear Red Hat Customer,

You were recently named on an order for new Red Hat subscriptions.  These
subscriptions are now available in the following account:

  Customer Name : {0}
  Account Number: {1}

You can click on the link below to create a new Red Hat Login for this account
and obtain access to your subscriptions:

{2}

If you are not the technical manager who will utilize the Red Hat subscription
services purchased, please forward this email to the appropriate user within
your organization.  If they do not already have a Red Hat Login, that user may
follow the link above to establish a new one.

If you already have a login and it is linked to the above account, then no
action is required.  You can find the account number linked to an existing Red
Hat Login by logging into the following page:

http://www.redhat.com/support/

If you already have a Red Hat Login that is linked to a different account than
the one listed on this email, and would like to use that account to manage these
subscriptions, Red Hat can transfer them to your desired account.  Please
contact your regional Red Hat Customer Service Representative, using the contact
information provided at the following link:

{3}

Note to the Account Administrator (Organization Administrator): Before a new
user can access subscriptions, you must grant them the ability to see and manage
the subscriptions on your account.  This requires that a User Administration
entitlement exist on your account.  If required, please follow the link above
and contact your regional Red Hat Customer Service Representative to request
this feature.

Thank you for choosing Red Hat.

Sincerely,
Red Hat Account Management Team

Dear Red Hat Customer,

The following system has been associated with your Red Hat login and
account in the past day, but could not be entitled to @@PRODUCT_NAME@@
services.

{0}

There are several reasons why this may have occurred:

1) You recently reinstalled a system and are attempting to associate
   the system with an existing, active subscription. Please ensure you
   delete your existing system profile on @@PRODUCT_NAME@@.

2) The number of systems you have connected to @@PRODUCT_NAME@@ exceeds
   the number of active Red Hat subscriptions associated with your
   account.  This may be because your subscriptions have expired or
   you need to purchase a Red Hat subscription.

   To check the expiration dates of your existing Red Hat
   subscriptions, please visit:

   https://www.redhat.com/apps/support/

   Log in and click on View and manage your subscriptions link.

3) You recently installed a Red Hat product and your subscription
   number was not successfully activated. If you would like to try and
   activate your subscription again, please visit:

   https://www.redhat.com/activate

For additional questions, please contact a Red Hat Customer Service
representative at:

http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/directory.html#custservice

Thank you for using @@PRODUCT_NAME@@.
