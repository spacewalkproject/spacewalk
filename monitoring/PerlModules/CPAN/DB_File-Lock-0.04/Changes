Revision history for Perl extension DB_File::Lock.

0.04 Fri Aug 11 09:08:48 EDT 2000
    - Three good fixes from Robert Mathews <rmathews@excitecorp.com>.
      (Thanks to him for submitting a patch!) In his own words:
      (1) The first one is nothing big: test 16 fails with BerkeleyDB
          v1.85 on solaris 5.6.  This seems to be due to the fact that
          we're creating a database (and therefore writing to it),
          but it's only read-locked.
      (2) The second is that TIEHASH assumes that SUPER::TIEHASH
          will succeed.  If it doesn't, the lockfile gets left open,
          and DESTROY is never called to close it.
      (3) I ran into one other issue: umask isn't restored if sysopen
          on the lockfile fails.  Fixed that too.

    - stupid me! version 0.02 didn't ship with a Makefile.PL, only a Makefile.old.
      seems that I deleted the wrong file before taring up the archive after testing.
    - Lock.pm didn't have $VERSION set correctly.

    - much improved documentation
    - much improved README
    - added notes to other DB_File wrapper locking functions in POD and README
    - fixed some incorrect assumptions about flock(2) in test.pl that ended
      up being wrong on both Solaris and HP-UX and caused two tests to fail.
