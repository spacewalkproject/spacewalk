Run the examples in this directory like indicated in the text below. 

-------------------------------------------------- 
1 Simple examples:

This is what a successful test looks like:

	perl -I ../lib procedural-ok-example.pl

This is what a failed test looks like:
	
	perl -I ../lib procedural-fail-example.pl
	
This is a screenshot of the GUI running (view with a PNG viewer,
e.g., your favorite web browser):
	
	tester.png

-------------------------------------------------- 
2 More involved examples:

These examples show how to build suites from other packages,
and how to add suites to each other:

	perl -I ../lib procedural-adding-suites-example.pl
	perl -I ../lib procedural-another-package-example.pl

The next example shows some ways to test other classes. 

Please note that the example named 'patch100132' will not run. 
It is just provided so you can see the difference between it 
and the (running) examples named 'patch100132-1' and 
'patch100132-2'.

	# will not run: patch100132
	
	perl -I ../lib -I ./ patch100132-1
	perl -I ../lib -I ./ patch100132-2

-------------------------------------------------- 
3 Example for TestDecorator and TestSetup:

perl -I../lib/ ../TestRunner.pl fail_example
