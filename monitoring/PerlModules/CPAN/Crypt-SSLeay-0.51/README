DESCRIPTION
    This perl module provides support for the https protocol under LWP, so
    that a LWP::UserAgent can make https GET & HEAD & POST requests. Please
    see perldoc LWP for more information on POST requests.

    The Crypt::SSLeay package contains Net::SSL, which is automatically
    loaded by LWP::Protocol::https on https requests, and provides the
    necessary SSL glue for that module to work via these deprecated modules:

       Crypt::SSLeay::CTX
       Crypt::SSLeay::Conn
       Crypt::SSLeay::X509

    Work on Crypt::SSLeay has been continued only to provide https support
    for the LWP - libwww perl libraries. If you want access to the OpenSSL
    API via perl, check out Sampo's Net::SSLeay.

INSTALL
  OpenSSL
    You must have OpenSSL or SSLeay installed before compiling this module.
    You can get the latest OpenSSL package from:

      http://www.openssl.org

    When installing openssl make sure your config looks like:

      > ./config --openssldir=/usr/local/openssl
     or
      > ./config --openssldir=/usr/local/ssl

    If you are planning on upgrading the default OpenSSL libraries on a
    system like RedHat, not that I would recommend this, then you might try
    something like:

      > ./config --openssldir=/usr --shared

    The --shared option to config will set up building the .so shared
    libraries which is important for such systems.

     then
      > make
      > make test
      > make install

    This way Crypt::SSLeay will pick up the includes and libraries
    automatically. If your includes end up going into a separate directory
    like /usr/local/include, then you may need to symlink
    /usr/local/openssl/include to /usr/local/include

  Crypt::SSLeay
    The latest Crypt::SSLeay can be found at your nearest CPAN, and also:

      http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/Crypt/

    Once you have downloaded it, Crypt::SSLeay installs easily using the
    make or nmake commands as shown below.

      > perl Makefile.PL
      > make
      > make test
      > make install

      * use nmake for win32

      !!! NOTE for Win32 users, few people seem to be able to build
      W  Crypt::SSLeay successfully on that platform.  You don't need
      I  to because ActiveState has already compiled it for you,
      N  and is available for their perl builds 618 & 522 as a ppm
      3  install.  It may also be available for their latest build.
      2  For problems with this, please contact ActiveState.
      !!!          Please see http://www.activestate.com/

PROXY SUPPORT
    LWP::UserAgent and Crypt::SSLeay have their own versions of proxy
    support. Please read these sections to see which one may be right for
    you.

  LWP::UserAgent Proxy Support
    LWP::UserAgent has its own methods of proxying which may work for you
    and is likely incompatible with Crypt::SSLeay proxy support. To use
    LWP::UserAgent proxy support, try something like:

      my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent;
      $ua->proxy([qw( https http )], "$proxy_ip:$proxy_port");

    At the time of this writing, libwww v5.6 seems to proxy https requests
    fine with an Apache mod_proxy server. It sends a line like:

      GET https://www.nodeworks.com HTTP/1.1

    to the proxy server, which is not the CONNECT request that some proxies
    would expect, so this may not work with other proxy servers than
    mod_proxy. The CONNECT method is used by Crypt::SSLeay's internal proxy
    support.

  Crypt::SSLeay Proxy Support
    For native Crypt::SSLeay proxy support of https requests, you need to
    set an environment variable HTTPS_PROXY to your proxy server & port, as
    in:

      # PROXY SUPPORT
      $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY} = 'http://proxy_hostname_or_ip:port';
      $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY} = '127.0.0.1:8080';

    Use of the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable in this way is similar to
    LWP::UserAgent->env_proxy() usage, but calling that method will likely
    override or break the Crypt::SSLeay support, so do not mix the two.

    Basic auth credentials to the proxy server can be provided this way:

      # PROXY_BASIC_AUTH
      $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY_USERNAME} = 'username';
      $ENV{HTTPS_PROXY_PASSWORD} = 'password';  

    For an example of LWP scripting with Crypt::SSLeay native proxy support,
    please see the source of the ./lwp-ssl-test script in the Crypt::SSLeay
    distribution.

CLIENT CERTIFICATE SUPPORT
    Certificate support is new provided by patches from Tobias Manthey. Is
    ALPHA as of .25, but looking pretty stable as of .29.

    PEM encoded certificate and private key files may be used like this:

      $ENV{HTTPS_CERT_FILE} = 'certs/notacacert.pem';
      $ENV{HTTPS_KEY_FILE}  = 'certs/notacakeynopass.pem';

    You may test your files with the ./net_ssl_test program by issuing a
    command like:

      ./net_ssl_test -cert=certs/notacacert.pem -key=certs/notacakeynopass.pem -d GET $HOST_NAME

    Additionally, if you would like to tell the client where the CA file is,
    you may set these. These *CA* configs are ALPHA as of version .29.

      $ENV{HTTPS_CA_FILE} = "some_file";
      $ENV{HTTPS_CA_DIR}  = "some_dir";

    There is no sample CA cert file at this time for testing, but you may
    configure ./net_ssl_test to use your CA cert with the -CAfile option.

  Creating a Test Certificate
    To create simple test certificates with openssl, you may:

         /usr/local/openssl/bin/openssl req -config /usr/local/openssl/openssl.cnf -new -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -x509 -keyout notacakey.pem -out notacacert.pem 

    To remove the pass phrase from the key file, execute this:
    /usr/local/openssl/bin/openssl rsa -in notacakey.pem -out
    notacakeynopass.pem

  PKCS12
    New as of version .45 is PKCS12 certificate support thanks to Daisuke
    Kuroda The directives for enabling use of these certificates is:

      $ENV{HTTPS_PKCS12_FILE}     = 'certs/pkcs12.pkcs12';
      $ENV{HTTPS_PKCS12_PASSWORD} = 'PKCS12_PASSWORD';

    Use of this type of certificate will take precedence over previous
    certificate settings described.

SSL VERSIONS
    Crypt::SSLeay tries very hard to connect to ANY SSL web server trying to
    accomodate servers that are buggy, old or simply not standards
    compliant. To this effect, this module will try SSL connections in this
    order:

      SSL v23  - should allow v2 & v3 servers to pick their best type
      SSL v3   - best connection type
      SSL v2   - old connection type

    Unfortunately, some servers seem not to handle a reconnect to SSL v3
    after a failed connect of SSL v23 is tried, so you may set before using
    LWP or Net::SSL:

      $ENV{HTTPS_VERSION} = 3;

    so that a SSL v3 connection is tried first. At this time only a SSL v2
    connection will be tried after this, as the connection attempt order
    remains unchanged by this setting.

BUILD NOTES
  Win32, WinNT, Win2000, can't build
    If you cannot get it to build on your windows box, try ActiveState perl,
    at least their builds 522 & 618 are known to have a ppm install of
    Crypt::SSLeay available. Please see http://www.activestate.com for more
    info.

  AIX 4.3.2 - Symbol Error: __umoddi3 : referenced symbol not found
    The __umoddi3 problem applies here as well when compiling with gcc.

    Alternative solution: In Makefile.PL, prepend "-L"/usr/local/<path to
    your gcc lib>/<version> to the $LIBS value. Add after line 82:

     $LIBS = '-L' . dirname(`gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`) . ' ' . $LIBS;

  Solaris x86 - Symbol Error: __umoddi3 : referenced symbol not found
     Problem:

    On Solaris x86, the default PERL configuration, and preferred, is to use
    the ld linker that comes with the OS, not gcc. Unfortunately during the
    OpenSSL build process, gcc generates in libcrypto.a, from bn_word.c, the
    undefined symbol __umoddi3, which is supposed to be later resolved by
    gcc from libgcc.a

    The system ld linker does not know about libgcc.a by default, so when
    building Crypt::SSLeay, there is a linker error for __umoddi3

     Solution:

    The fix for this symlink your libgcc.a to some standard directory like
    /usr/local/lib, so that the system linker, ld, can find it when building
    Crypt::SSLeay.

  FreeBSD 2.x.x / Solaris - ... des.h:96 #error _ is defined ...
    If you encounter this error: "...des.h:96: #error _ is defined, but some
    strange definition the DES library cannot handle that...," then you need
    to edit the des.h file and comment out the "#error" line.

    Its looks like this error might be common to other operating systems,
    and that occurs with OpenSSL 0.9.3. Upgrades to 0.9.4 seem to fix this
    problem.

  SunOS 4.1.4, Perl 5.004_04 - ld.so: Undefined symbol: _CRYPT_mem_ctrl
    Problems: (initial build was fine, but execution of Perl scripts had
    problems)

    Got a message "ld.so: Undefined symbol: _CRYPT_mem_ctrl" solution: In
    the Makefile, comment out the line with "-fpic" (also try changing to
    "-fPIC", and this works also, not sure if one is preferred).
