NAME
    Error - Error/exception handling in an OO-ish way

DESCRIPTION
    The Error package provides two interfaces. Firstly Error provides
    a procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly Error is a
    base class for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for
    subsequent catch, or can simply be recorded.

    Errors in the class Error should not be thrown directly, but the
    user should throw errors from a sub-class of Error

SYNOPSIS

    use Error qw(:try);

    throw Error::Simple( "A simple error");

    sub xyz {
        ...
	record Error::Simple("A simple error")
	    and return;
    }
 
    unlink($file) or throw Error::Simple("$file: $!",$!);

    try {
	do_some_stuff();
	die "error!" if $condition;
	throw Error::Simple -text => "Oops!" if $other_condition;
    }
    catch Error::IO with {
	my $E = shift;
	print STDERR "File ", $E->{'-file'}, " had a problem\n";
    }
    except {
	my $E = shift;
	my $general_handler=sub {send_message $E->{-description}};
	return {
	    UserException1 => $general_handler,
	    UserException2 => $general_handler
	};
    }
    otherwise {
	print STDERR "Well I don't know what to say\n";
    }
    finally {
	close_the_garage_door_already(); # Should be reliable
    }; # Don't forget the trailing ; or you might be surprised
