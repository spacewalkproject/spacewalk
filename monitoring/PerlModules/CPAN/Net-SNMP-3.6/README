                       Net::SNMP, version 3.60 

NAME

    Net::SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol

DESCRIPTION

    The module Net::SNMP implements an object oriented interface to
    the Simple Network Management Protocol.  Perl applications can
    use the module to retrieve or update information on a remote
    host using the SNMP protocol.  Net::SNMP is implemented completely
    in Perl, requires no compiling, and uses only standard Perl 
    modules.  Both SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c (Community-Based SNMPv2) are
    supported by the module.  The Net::SNMP module assumes that the
    user has a basic understanding of the Simple Network Management 
    Protocol and related network management concepts.

INSTALLATION

    To install, cd to the directory containing the unpacked
    distribution and do one of the following:

        a.  Create a makefile by running Perl against Makefile.PL and 
            then run make:

                perl Makefile.PL
                make test
                make install

        b.  Copy or move the file lib/Net/SNMP.pm from the distribution
            into a directory named Net in a Perl library directory. 

DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation is included at the end of the module in POD format.
