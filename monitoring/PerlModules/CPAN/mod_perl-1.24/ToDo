SHORT TERM STUFF (this section should always be empty in a release version!)
                 (well, close to it anyhow)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- {get,set}_handlers troubles [Geoffrey Young <gyoung@laserlink.net>]

- remove eg/ directory, it's way out of date and no longer needed now
  with the guide, the books, and piles of Apache::* modules

- do something about FreshRestart+dso ? (vivek)

- PERL_STATIC_EXTS doesnt work with USE_APACI=1

- solaris Perl Configure adds a space before -R in ccdlflags, see
  about removing that
  [Ken McNamara <conmara@oaktree.net>]

- see if possible to have the dso libperl.so be named something else,
  e.g. libmodperl.so 
  [Eugene B. Byrganov <E.B.Byrganov@inp.nsk.su]

- ldopts() spits out ccdlflags when linker is ld

- Makefile.PL should always push load_modules.pl for 'make test' 

- recursion triggered by internal_redirect() called by a pushed handler
[Ashish Goyal <ashishg@linux-delhi.org>]

- auth stuff segfaults if AuthType isn't set
[Matt Sergeant <matt@sergeant.org>]

- Support of <CR> <LF> in a EBCDIC environment
[Ignasi Roca <ignasi.roca@fujitsu.siemens.es>]

- rename PerlSendHeader?

- syswrite/WRITE

- libapreq: Apache::Cookie format sync w/ CGI.pm

- remove DIR_MAGIC_TYPE from mod_perl's handler table, if possible (Salvador)

- should Apache::Registry use -M or (stat _)[9]?

- ActivePerl?

- Apache::Include->virtual should return run() value, not status()

- think about making 'use Apache::Log ()' automatic

- coderef to $r->custom_response
[Randal L. Schwartz <merlyn@stonehenge.com>]

- Apache::PerlRun::flush_namespace should be re-written in c

- should $r->content unset $r->headers_in('content-length') ?
NOTE: im worried this could break apps who need to know content-length 
after data has been read

KNOWN BUGS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Gerald's report of Embperl/sub-request/print breakage

- need turn of strip of httpd during 'make install' ?

- SSIs executed using /bin/sh, not suexec as configured?
  Theo Van Dinter <felicity@kluge.net>

- /perl/perl-status?sig dumps core under hpux 10.20
   [David-Michael.Lincke@unisg.ch]

- $r cannot use many api methods during ChildInit/ChildExit -> SEGV

- bytes_sent are not logged if header don't go through send_http_header(), 
  e.g CGI->header(-nph => 1, ...)
              Eric Cholet <cholet@logilune.com>

- SIGALRM/flock, Lincoln Stein <lstein@cshl.org>
 I often use this type of code to handle possibly blocked flocks():

        local($timed_out) = 0;
        local($SIG{ALRM}) = sub { $timed_out++; die "timed out"; }
        alarm(5);
        eval {
                flock(FH,LOCK_EX);
        }
        alarm(0);
        if ($timed_out) {
           print "We timed out.  Sorry.";
        }

 This has been working in standalone CGI scripts, but no longer works
 in mod_perl.  The signal handler gets called, but then the flock()
 call seems to be restarted. It never exit the eval.  So this is no big 
 deal, I just replace the blocking flock() with a poll.

- find a way to prevent "httpd spinning" (bug in Perl, not mod_perl)

- linkage problem w/ mod_auth_dbm (-ldbm)
 Config.pm New: libs='-lsocket -lnsl -ldl -lm -lc -lcrypt -ldb'
 Was:           libs='-lsocket -lnsl -ldb -ldl -lm -lc -lcrypt'

- perl_config should not av_shift ARRAY refs from
  %Apache::ReadConfig::

- die and AUTOLOADed DESTROY == empty $@ (Perl or mod_perl bug?)

- ExtUtils::Embed/ExtUtils::Liblist clash sometime w/
  PERL_STATIC_EXTS, like so: 
 Unrecognized argument in LIBS ignored:
 '/opt/oracle/product/7.3.3/lib/libclient.a' 

 Note (probably harmless): No library found for -l:libcma.sl

- From: brian moore <bem@CMC.NET>
  As Apacheweek reported a couple weeks ago, 'some' modules on Solaris have
  problems with the mutex locking method used by 1.3b5.  One of which is
  mod_perl.  To make it work I had to -DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT or
  the server would never answer a request.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN MODULE BUGS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- can't multiple Apache::Include->virtual in a single request

- files that have been created after the server's (child?) startup are
  being reported with negative age with -M test under Apache::Registry. 
  The workaround is to add $^T = time; at the beginning of the scripts. But
  it would be much better if the Apache::Registry will do that
