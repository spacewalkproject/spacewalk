=head1 NAME

CREDITS - The many mod_perl contributors 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

While Doug MacEachern is behind the majority of mod_perl's design,
code and documentation, he and mod_perl never would have made it this
far without the help from everyone in the mod_perl community.  His
heartfelt thanks goes out to all of you! 

There are thousands of people who have contributed to what mod_perl is
today.  This file is here to recognize the tremendous efforts of the
major contributors to the mod_perl effort.  

This file is generated by a Perl script which sorts by name.

to try out new features, before they are even documented!

=item Doug Bagley (doug@dejanews.com)

Doug Bagley has pinpointed some of the nastiest mod_perl bugs while
claiming to know nothing about xs.  He's also made improvements to the
Apache::SIG module along with writing the valuable Apache::SizeLimit
module.  

=item Edmund Mergl (E.Mergl@bawue.de) 

Edmund revolutionized database connectivity with his Apache::DBI
module for persistent connections via DBI, providing a tremendous
performance boost for database intensive apps.  He's also written the
popular Apache::AuthenDBI and Apache::AuthzDBI packages for
authentication and authorizing against databases via DBI.

=item Eric Cholet (cholet@logilune.com)

Involved with many heroic debugging sessions.

=item Gisle Aas (aas@sn.no)

Gisle wrote an early "proof-of-concept" mod_perl.c and perl_glue.xs
March 25, 1996 to be exact.  While next to none of that code is
present in the current mod_perl source, as the embedded model and
XS <-> Apache API interface were changed, it was an important
insipirational kick start to what mod_perl has become today.    

Gisle has also contributed to mod_perl's Apache::Constants module,
along with API enhancements and documentation.

=item Jan Pazdziora (adelton@fi.muni.cz)

Jan is the author of the Apache-OutputChain package.

Maintainer of the mod_perl NT binary distribution and author of the

Everybody knows Lincoln gave us the must-have CGI.pm module, he's put
forth considerable effort porting and optimizing it for mod_perl.
Lincoln also wrote the original Apache::Request module, a CGI.pm-like
module on top of the Apache API.  Lincoln's code and prose in the
upcoming mod_perl book is a major step towards world peace.

=item Mark Imbriaco (perlhacker@earthlink.net)

For setting up the original mod_perl mail list and administration of
that list for two years.
Mark was also the first person besides Doug to write an Apache::* module,
the first version of Apache::ePerl.

It was Rob's kicking that made the mod_perl CVS tree come to be.

Salvador has helped bang out bugs and traps with sfio enabled
mod_perls, along with various bug spotting and stopping since the
early days.  He has also contributed to the Apache/Perl API.

=head1 The Apache and Perl communities

If there was no Apache, there would be no mod_perl.

If there was no Perl, there would be no mod_perl.

We owe a great deal of thanks to The Apache Group, Larry Wall and the
perl5-porters, along with the communities that support them both.
