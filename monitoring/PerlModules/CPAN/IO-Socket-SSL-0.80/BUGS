- IO::Socket::SSL::close(). the following lines have been commented out
  because of problems with self-tied filehandles:
	#my $prev = untie(*$self);
	#return $self->SUPER::close();

  calling these functions on self-tied filehandles has been reported to fail
  at least on RedHat v6.x based linux systems with:
	perl v5.6.0		- 'make test' (perl -w) dumps core 
	perl v5.005_03		- ok
	perl prior to v5.005_03 - endless loop

  you may want to test if everything works ok after uncommenting these lines.
