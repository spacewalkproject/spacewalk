This is Net::RawIP, a perl module can to manipulate raw IP packets,
with an optional feature for manipulating Ethernet headers.

NOTE: Ethernet related methods currently implemented only on Linux and *BSD!
Help with port eth.c to other platforms is very appreciated.

You need perl 5.004 or later to use this module.
You need to have installed libpcap, available from

ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z

You install the module by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

There are also some example scripts.
