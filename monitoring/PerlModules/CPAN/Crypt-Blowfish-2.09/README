This is Crypt::Blowfish version 2.09, an XS-based implementation of the
Blowfish cryptography algorithm designed by Bruce Schneier.  It's designed
to take full advantage of Crypt::CBC when desired.  Blowfish keys may be
up to 448 bits (56 bytes) long.  This module builds on nearly every platform
that Perl itself does (see Notes for exceptions).

Prerequisites
-------------

For the full test suite to run, Crypt::CBC, version 1.22 or higher
is required (recommended is 1.25 or higher), however this module 
is not mandatory for standalone Blowfish use.  

Additionally, the author has Crypt::CBC_R available (email address 
below for details) which replaces the default 'RandomIV' 
initialization vector string that Crypt::CBC uses with a random 
string.  (random to the limitations that /dev/urandom and friends are)

Installing Crypt::Blowfish
--------------------------

nothing unusual:

	1. perl Makefile.PL
	2. make
	3. make test
	4. make install

Notes
-----

This module has been tested successfully against the following:
Linux 2.0.X (x86)
Linux 2.2.X (x86, PPC, Alpha, m68k)
Linux 2.4.X (x86)
Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.7 (SPARC)
FreeBSD 3.3 and 3.4 (x86), 4.0 (alpha)
HP-UX B.10.20
DEC OSF 5.0
AIX spbuild 3 4
Win32 (NT4/SP5, using VC++5.0/VC++6.0)
OpenVMS (DEC C V6.0-001 / Alpha V7.1-2  with MMK make utility)

Perl 5.004_01, 5.004_04, 5.005_03, 5.6.0, and 5.6.1

Please send other successful OS/platform combinations to:

Patches for MacOS welcomed.

Being an XS implimentation, Crypt::Blowfish is exceptionally faster
than Blowfish_PP (a pure Perl implimentation).  Internal testing 
displayed a difference of 400 times faster when doing complete 
cipher generation and encryption.  Using a cached cipher resulted 
in 25 times faster than the pure Perl implimentation. (all machines 
idled prior to tests below)

In the case where this module won't build for you, please try the
Crypt::Blowfish_PP module - the Pure Perl implimentation.

Thanks to Thomas Kratz for the Win32 fixup and VMS report.
