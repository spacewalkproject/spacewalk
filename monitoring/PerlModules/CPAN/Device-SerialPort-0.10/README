Device::SerialPort
VERSION=0.09, 25 Jan 2001

Hello Serial Port users:

If you are running Windows 95 or later, you want the Win32::SerialPort
module instead of this one. It has a compatible user interface.
Available from your favorite CPAN site. Since someone asked, there is
not currently an equivalent for MS-DOS (and none is anticipated).

This is a POSIX-based version of the Win32::Serialport module ported by
Joe Doss for the MisterHouse Home Automation Package from Version 0.08
of the Win32 module. He replaced calls to the Win32 API with similar
functions implemented using POSIX calls. While most of the testing has
occurred on linux, the package should work on other POSIX-compliant
Operating Systems.

Most of the functions from Win32::SerialPort are now available. Almost
all the demos and examples work with minimal modifications. Many of the
methods are new with this release or 0.06, so expect a few bugs and
consider everything experimental. But the intent is to "clone" the
corresponding features of the Win32::SerialPort module whenever
practical - see the documentation for that module as well as this one
for details.

Version 0.07 improved the lockfile support, added some application
variables that are saved in the configuration_file, and added the
ioctl-based methods status, modemlines, and write_done. These act
mostly like their Win32 cousins. Since they use ioctls, they are
only available on systems that "can_ioctl".

There are a small number of ioctl calls to handle the RTS and DTR
outputs. Those require (from more or less traditional locations) the
outputs from "h2ph" for ioctl.h and related files. If the module does
not find the prerequisites, it disables the method calls that require
them and sets "can_ioctl" false.
	.../_h2ph_pre.ph	.../asm/termios.ph
	.../asm/termbits.ph	.../asm/posix_types.ph
	.../asm/ioctls.ph	.../asm/ioctl.ph
	.../linux/posix_types.ph

This module does not require a compiler or use XS. Since everything is
(convoluted but still pure) perl, you can fix flaws and change limits
if required. But please file a bug report if you do. I have tested with
Perl 5.005_02 on Redhat 5.2. Some testing has occurred on AIX and Solaris
as well.

Version 0.09 adds further compatibility for other OSes, including AIX,
Solaris, and OpenBSD.  Kees Cook is now maintaining this code for use
with the Sendpage tool (http://sendpage.cpoint.net/).  

COMPATIBILITY NOTES:

1. Earlier versions of this module were named SerialPort_Linux.pm or
   just SerialPort.pm. The examples in alpha version 0.02 (limited
   release only) work fine when the Namespace is updated.

2. The Tied FileHandle support works fully on 5.005, mostly on 5.004,
   and essentially NOT on 5.003. This is due to the level of support
   in the underlying Perl - not to the module implementation. The module
   supports all tie methods and even handles output_separators.

3. Unlike Win32::SerialPort, this distribution uses Makefile.PL and the
   "standard" install sequence for CPAN modules:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

4. The GetTickCount method has been renamed to get_tick_count to conform
   to normal naming style. A corresponding method has been added to the
   Win32 version to facilitate portability.

5. The save, start, and restart methods are now supported. The format of
   the configuration_file is not identical to the Win32 one.

6. Version 0.07 changes parts of the configuration_file. You will need
   to save a new one - files from previous versions will not work.

7. OpenBSD does NOT support getting modem lines (!?), so that test will
   fail, and no carrier detection will be possible.  This is being
   worked on.

8. Right now, AIX will also fail some of the tests, including setting
   hardware flow control.  I'm working on fixing this.

See the NOTES and KNOWN LIMITATIONS in the SerialPort documentation. The
".pod" is embedded in the ".pm". The comments on "-w" and "use strict"
are especially relevant when you start calling this module from your own
code. Special thanks to Joe Doss for the initial porting. And to Bruce
Winter for the "required *.ph" list. Also thanks to the others who have
contributed comments and suggestions.  Thanks to Aaron Botsis for letting
me play with his OpenBSD box and watching DTR lights for me.

INSTALL and TEST:

You will need suitable permissions to open the port. If the port is also
used for logins, you will need to create a lockfile (/var/lock/LCK..ttyS0)
on my Redhat 5.2 system. Just touch it, the contents are not important.
They may be someday. But not yet. You might need to be "root" for that.

Run 'perl Makefile.PL' followed by 'make'. This will create install files
and directories. Run 'make test' with nothing connected to "/dev/ttyS0".
This will run the tests and create a configuration_file. You can specify
a different port to test via 'perl Makefile.PL PORT'. Makefile.PL creates
"t/DefaultPort.pm". You can also specify an alternate port with the Shell
Variable "Makefile_Test_Port".

The Benchmark routines are used to generate reports. The test suite
covers many of the module methods and sets the port for 9600 baud,
1 stop, 8 data, no parity, no handshaking, and other defaults. At
various points in the testing, it expects unconnected CTS and DTR lines.
The module should restore any port settings on exit. But this has not
been exhaustively tested yet.

Tests may also be run individually by typing:
	'perl test?.t Page_Delay [/dev/ttySx]'

With no delay, the tests execute too rapidly to follow from a command
line. Delay may be set from 0 to 5 seconds.

All tests are expected to pass - I would be very interested in hearing
about failures ("not ok"). These tests should be run from a command
prompt.

DEMO PROGRAMS:

Connect a dumb terminal (or a PC that acts like one) to /dev/ttyS0 and
setup the equivalent configuration. Starting demo1.plx should print a
three line message on both the terminal and the command line. The
terminal keyboard (only) now accepts characters which it prints to both
screens until a CONTROL-Z is typed. Also included is demo2.plx - a truly
minimal chat program. Bi-directional communication without an event loop,
sockets, pipes (or much utility ;-) This one uses CAPITAL-Q from the
active keyboard to quit since <STDIN> doesn't like CONTROL-Z.

AltPort.pm and test3.t implement the "basic Inheritance test" discussed
in perltoot and other documentation. It also imports the :PARAM constants.
It's otherwise only slightly modified from test1.t (you'll get a different
"alias" in test3.t).

Run options.plx to see the available choices for various parameters
along with the current values. If you have trouble, I will probably
ask you to save the output of options.plx in a file and send it to me.
You can specify a port name for options.plx on the command line
(e.g. 'perl options.plx COM2').

You can read (many of the important) settings with demo3.plx. If you
give it a (valid) configuration file on the command line, it will open
the port with those parameters - so you can test simple changes: see
the parity example at the end of demo3.plx.

Demo4.plx is a "minimum" script showing just the basics needed to get
started.

Demo5.plx demonstrates various uses of the lookfor routine including
setups for "waitfor" and a primitive "readline". Try them out. The
default "stty" settings work with a VT-100 style terminal. You may
have to set the options by hand. Use any editor. Let me know if the
descriptions in the documentation are useable. And if any more options
are necessary.

Demo6.plx demonstrates tied FileHandles. Perl 5.005 is recommended.
It "requires" 5.004. It implements timeouts on all user inputs - so
you can run it "hands-off" to see what happens.

Demo7.plx uses Tk to create a terminal emulator. Its included to show
polling and callbacks using an event loop.

Demo8.plx is a simple command-line terminal emulator contributed by
Andrej Mikus.

The Perl Journal #13 included an article on Controlling a Modem with
Win32::SerialPort. Slightly revised versions of all the Examples
from the article are included in the "eg" subdirectory. The revisions
cover cross-platform use and workarounds for small timing differences.

Please tell me what does and what doesn't work. The module has proven
to be pretty robust. But I can't test all possible configurations.
Don't trust it for anything important without complete testing.

And watch for updates at:
