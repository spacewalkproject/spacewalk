			XML::Parser Version 2.30

Copyright (c) 1998-2000 Larry Wall and Clark Cooper.
All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself. 

This is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl and it requires that you have
release 1.95.0 or greater of expat installed. You can download expat
from:

	 http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

The documentation for this extension can be found in pod format at the end
of the files Parser.pm and Expat/Expat.pm. The perldoc program, provided with
the perl distribution, can be used to view this documentation.

This was modified from the original XML::Parser created by Larry Wall.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

There are some sample utilities in the samples directory along with an
xml form of the XML specification to test them on. You may need to change
the '#!' line at the top of these utilities to what is appropriate for
your system. If you're going to play around with them prior to installing
the module, you would need to add the blib paths to your perl search
path, like this (assuming your current directory is samples):

    perl -I../blib/lib -I../blib/arch xmlcomments REC-xml-19980210.xml

or set your PERLLIB environment variable.

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

Discussion on features and bugs of this software and general discussion
on topics relating to perl and XML takes place on the perl-xml mailing
list, to which you can subscribe by sending mail to:

    subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com

Differences from Version 2.29
=============================

Expat is no longer included with this package. It must now be already
installed on your system as a library. You may download the library
version of expat from http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/. After
downloading, expat must be configured (an automatic script does this),
built and installed.

A workaround has been provided for those people who couldn't compile
Expat.xs with a perl 5.6.0 with USE_5005THREADS on.

A bug that prevented IO::Handler from being read by the parse method
has been fixed.

Fixed a bug in reading external entities with incremental parsing.
