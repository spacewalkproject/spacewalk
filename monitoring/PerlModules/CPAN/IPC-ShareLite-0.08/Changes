          to patch from Sam Tregar <sam@tregar.com>
        - renamed all _func names to sharelite_func due to conflict

	- now using metaconfig to determine whether semun definition
	  is available -- thanks to Paul J. Schinder <schinder@pobox.com>.

0.03 Thu Nov 19 12:36:06 PST 1998
	- changed shlock() and shunlock() to lock() and unlock().
	  old names were confusing.  Old names remain but are
	  deprecated.
	- added accessor methods for key, exclusive, etc.
	- added _initialize() method
	- added retry for EIDRM error when allocating additional
          segments
	- added version() method for use with per-process caches
	- moved segment state variable from semaphore to shared
          memory (it's faster)
        - modified documentation

0.02  Sat Nov 14 05:20:01 1998 
	- removed signal stuff from tests
	- added destroy() accessor method
	- added check for EINVAL when locking semaphore in new_share()
	- replaced lock_ex() and lock_sh() methods with single shlock()
          method that accepts flock() flags.  Renamed unlock() to
          shunlock().
	- LOCK_EX, LOCK_SH, LOCK_UN, and LOCK_NB now available for import.
	- replaced sv_setpvn() call with sv_usepvn() in read_share()
          XS function to remove an unnecessary mem copy.
	- modified documentation.
