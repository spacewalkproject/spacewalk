This is a list over things that we plan to implement in libwww-perl-5.
The order of items does not reflect priority.

  o  HTTP/1.1 support is on its way.  This also includes support of
     multiple parallel connections.  Take a look at LWPng (aka
     libwww-perl-6).

  o  Provide initial credentials so that we don't always have to get a
     401 response first.  Both for Basic and Digest authentication.  This
     is in fact implemented for LWPng.

  o  Support PICS??

  o  Cache previous ftp connections.  "Keep-Alive"?

  o  Support MOVE and DELETE methods for ftp.

  o  Use Mail::Send to implement LWP::Protocol::mailto.  Today we just
     invoke sendmail directly, which is not very portable.

  o  The lwp-request -o processing should check for Content-Encoding as
     well as Content-Type.

  o  The lwp-request script should optionally consult Mail::Cap for
     handling of media types.

  o  The lwp-request script should use the callback interface so it can
     print data as it is received.

  o  The lwp-mirror script should be able to work recursively.

  o  Include more useful programs

  o  More documentation

  o  More tests

  o  Fix bugs, if there are any...
