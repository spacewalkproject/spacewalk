 o  HTTP::Cookies now ignore the Expires field in Set-Cookie, if the
    date provided can't be parsed by HTTP::Date.

 o  The lwp-request script now use URI::Heuristic for it's URL arguments.
    It means that 'lwp-request perl' will not get a file called "./perl"
    but will fetch the page "http://www.perl.com" or something similar.
    If you want to get the file you have to prefix it with "./".  Full
    URLs are never affected by this.

 o  LWP::Simple::get() will bypass LWP for simple HTTP requests.  This
    should make it somewhat faster.

 o  LWP::RobotUA has a new method called $ua->use_sleep() that

    document better. Initial patch from Nicolai Langfeldt
    <janl@math.uio.no>.

    more.  I wonder how Netscape managed to not implement this
    correctly all this time.

 o  Added lots of modern tags to HTML::AsSubs.

 o  HTTP::Request::Common will read uploaded files in binmode().
    This should be better for Win32 systems.  Contributed by

 o  HTML::FormatText: can specify margins in the constructor.

 o  URI::URL: the base will be absolutized internally now.

 o  URI::URL will take advantage of void context provided by perl5.004.
    This means that using $u->path and $u->query should be safer now.

 o  URI::URL->print_on defaults to STDERR now (used to be STDOUT).

 o  URI::URL: removed version 3 compatibility stuff ($COMPAT_VER_3).

 o  $ua->mirror should work better on dosish systems (can not
    rename when target file exists).

 o  Typo in lwp-download prevented it from compiling.

 o  Some minor documentations typos corrected.



Sat Sep 20 1997   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

 o  Release 5.13

 o  Brand new module called HTTP::Cookies.  It stores cookies
    (Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers) from responses and can
    create appropriate Cookie headers for requests.  It can also
    share cookie files with Netscape.

 o  LWP::UserAgent now support the cookie_jar() attribute.  When
    set to an HTTP::Cookies object, it will automatically manage
    the cookies sent to the servers.  Off by default.

 o  New header utility functions in HTTP::Headers::Util.

 o  Win32 and OS/2 patches for the lwp-xxx utilities.  Turn on
    binary mode by default (option to turn it off), avoid modifying $0,

    is used by URI::URL when it determines anonymous ftp login address.
	
 o  lwp-download: New program in the bin directory

 o  HTML::Parser: Allow '_' in attribute names.  This makes it possible
    to parse Netscape's bookmarks.html file.

    in get_request().  Support HTTP/0.9 clients.

 o  Don't clobber regex variables when HTTP::Message delegates methods
    to the header.

 o  File::Listing updates from William York <william@mathworks.com>. We
    can now parse the MS-Windows ftp server listings.

 o  HTTP::Date now supports the MS-Windows 'dir' date format.  Patch by
    William York.

 o  LWP::MediaTypes::media_suffix will return first type in scalar context.



Tue Oct 22 1996   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

 o  Release 5.04

 o  Added HTTP::Daemon.  This is a HTTP/1.1 server class.  This means
    that libwww-perl no longer is a client library only.  The HTTP::Daemon
    is also used in the new test suite.

 o  HTTP::Message support the protocol() method.  Used by HTTP::Daemon.

 o  HTTP::Response can be constructed with a header and content as
    argument.

 o  Typo corrections in the documentation.

 o  File::Listing::parse_dir accepts "GMT" as timezone now.

 o  HTML::Parser will call the start() method with two new parameters;
    $attrseq, $origtext.

 o  Integrated HTML::FormatPS patches from
    Jim Stern <jstern@world.northgrum.com>

 o  Class modules don't inherit from AutoLoader any more.  They just
    import the AUTOLOAD method.

 o  Digest does not send "opaque" if it was not present in the request.
    The "Extension" header is not returned any more.

 o  New method: $url->crack that will return a list of the various
    elements in a URI::URL.

 o  WWW::RobotRules did not use the agent() method when determining
    who we are.  This affected WWW::RobotRules::AnyDBM_File parsing
    for robots.txt.  Visit count did not increment for
    WWW::RobotRules::InCore.



Tue Oct  1 1996   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

    future.  It includes the new WWW::RobotRules::AnyDBM_File class
    and updates to LWP::RobotUA.

 o  HTML::Parser now supports buggy Netscape comment parsing.  Enable
    it by calling $p->netscape_buggy_comment(1).  The previous version
    of the parser could also (under very unlucky and unlikely
    circumstances) call the $self->comment() method several times for
    the same comment text.

 o  HTML::Parser: Use new $p->eof to signal end of document instead of
    $p->parse(undef).

 o  HTML::Element::starttag() is now smarter about which quotes it
    use around attribute values.

    is_fresh(), fresh_until().

 o  HTTP::Message:  New method ($mess->content_ref) which will return
    a reference to the current content.

 o  URI::URL:  New method ($url->rel) which does the opposite of abs().
    Example: url("http://host/a/b/c", "http://host/c/d/e")->rel would
    return url("../../a/b/c", "http://host/c/d/e").  This was
    suggested by Nicolai Langfeldt <janl@ifi.uio.no>

 o  URI::URL:  $url->query_form can now take array references as value
    specification.  For instance: $url->query_form(foo => ['bar', 'baz']

 o  Avoid '"my" variable $var masks earlier declaration in same scope'
    warnings in perl5.003_05.

 o  Made $header->authorization_basic return "uname:passwd" in scalar
    context

 o  LWP::Protocol::collect() will let the HTML::HeadParser look at the
    document content as it arrives.  This will initialize headers from
    elements like <base href="...">, <title>...</title> and <meta
    http-equiv="..." ...>.

 o  Simplified $response->base implementation, because we don't have
    to look into the content any more.

    at places where we <> or print.

 o  Always localize $_ before any 'while(<FILE>) {}'-loops

 o  Implemented $protocol->collect_once() and simplified several
    of the protocol implementations by using it.

 o  The HTML parser used to get it wrong if you were unlucky about the
    breakup of the text. An example of broken behaviour was this:

    perl4 as 'perl'.  The mirror script is not installed by
    default.

 o  LWP::Socket::_getaddress() Numerical IP adresses did not work.

 o  LWP::Socket::pushback() did not work.  This also avoids the bad
    pp_select() core dump from perl.

 o  LWP::IO now also selects on socket exceptions.

 o  HTML::Parse:  Ignore <!DOCTYPE ...> regardless for case.  Some
    bad insertElement() calls made infinite loops.

    hole with the old implementation of getBasicCredentials().

 o  LWP::Protocol::file now sets Content-Encoding headers

 o  Allow request content to be provided by a callback routine.

 o  Fix bug that prevented response callback to work.  The first parameter
    (data) is no longer a reference, because $_[0] is already a reference.
    Don't callback unless successful response.  Callbacks during redirects
    was confusing.

 o  URI::URL.  Remove port from netloc if it is the default port.
    Don't use anything, just require.

 o  HTTP::Message->addContent() does not need a reference parameter.

 o  LWP::Socket->open() has been renamed top LWP::Socket->connect()
    LWP::Socket->close has gone.  Implemented new method LWP::Socket->read()

       LWP::MIMEheader --> HTTP::Headers
       LWP::StatusCode --> HTTP::Status
       LWP::Message    --> HTTP::Message
       LWP::Request    --> HTTP::Request
       LWP::Response   --> HTTP::Response
       LWP::MIMEtypes  --> LWP::MediaTypes

       - Update the @header_order according to the August 3rd draft.
       - Added Response Header fields: 'Location', 'Public', 'Retry-After',
         'Server', and 'WWW-Authenticate'.
       - Moved 'unknown header' handling from &scan to &header. The old
         implementation was forcing all unknown header-words to begin with
	 an uppercase (as it should be), but disallowed other uppercase
	 letters.
       - updates the status code messages under the August
         3rd HTTP/1.0 draft.  '203' became 'Non-Authoritative Information',
	 '303' became 'See Other', and a new code,
	 '411 Authorization Refused', was added.

 o  Can remove multiple headers with single removeHeader() call in MIMEheader.

 o  Can assign multiple field/value pairs in header() method of MIMEheader.

 o  A field with multiple values is printed as separate values in
    MIMEheader::as_string().

 o  LWP::Response contain new attributes: previous() and request().  These
    attributes are updated by the UserAgent.

 o  Appended \n to some die statements in Socket so that line numbers are
    suppressed in error messages.

 o  Made UserAgent::clone work for reference members

 o  Check for redirect loops and multiple authorization failures by
    examination of the response chain.

 o  Use "\015\012" instead of "\r\n" in protocol modules.  Some systems
    define \r and \n differently.

 o  request program can now handle documents that needs autorization by
    prompting the user for username/password. Added new -S option to print
    request/response chain.

 o  Moved "header" and "content" into LWP::Message class.  This change made
    LWP::Request and LWP::Response much simpler.  Made clone() method
    actually work.

 o  LWP::Protocol::implementor does not die if it cannot load package.

 o  Moved UserAgent convenience methods into LWP::Simple.  Made LWP::Simple
    export LWP::StatusCode symbols and functions.

 o  Implemented $ua->isProtocolSupported($scheme) method.

 o  Nicer directory listing in LWP::Protocol::file.pm

 o  Rely on URI::URL 3.00 behaviour for $url->full_path

 o  Library version number now in LWP.pm.  You should be able to say
    "use LWP 1.0;" if you need at least this version.

 o  Various cleanups and arranging layout as I like it.  Use fooBar-style
    (as opposed to foo_bar stype) everywhere.  This means that as_string()
    now is called asString().

 o  Added more documentation.

It's getting there...



Mon May 22 1995   Martijn Koster <m.koster@nexor.co.uk>

    into a module of its own.



Thu 18 May 1995   Martijn Koster <m.koster@nexor.co.uk>

 o  Mentioned on libwww-perl that I had changed the classes around lots.
