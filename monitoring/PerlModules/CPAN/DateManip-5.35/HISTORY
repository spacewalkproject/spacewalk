   Added Swedish translation (thanks to Andreas Johansson
      <Andreas.XS.Johansson@trab.se>
   Fixed bad mistake in documentation (use Date::Manip instead of
      use DateManip) pointed out by tuc@valhalla.stormking.com
   Fixed bug introduced in 5.04 when default day set to 1.  When no
      date given, have day default to today rather than 1.  It only
      defaults to one if a partial date is given.
   Changed deltas to be all positive or all negative when produced by
      DateCalc.  Suggested by Steve Braun <braun@gandalf.sp.trw.com>
   Fixed bug where Date_DaysSince999 returned the wrong value (the
      error did not affect any other functions in Date::Manip due to
      the way it was called and the nature of the error).  Pointed out
      by Jason Baker <bm11455@themis.ag.gov.bc.ca>.
   Minor improvements to documentation.
   Documented the 'sort within a sort' bug.
   Added DateManipVersion routine.
   Dates with commas in them are now read properly.
   Now supports timezones.
   Parses RFC 822 dates (thanks to J.B. Nicholson-Owens
      <jbn@mystery-train.cu-online.com> for suggestion).
   Parses ctime() date formats (suggested by Matthew R. Sheahan
      <chaos@crystal.palace.net>).
   Added Date_ConvTZ routine for timezone support.
   Fixed two places where a variable was declared twice using my (thanks
      to Ric Steinberger <ric@isl.sri.com>).
   Hopefully fixed installation problems.
   Now supports times like "noon" and "midnight".
   Got rid of the last (I think) couple of US specific strings.
   The time separators are now language specific so the French can
      write "10h30" and the Swedes can write "10.30".  Suggested by
      Andreas Johansson <Andreas.XS.Johansson@trab.se>.
   Fixed type in documentation/README pointed out by James K. Bence
      <jbence@math.ucla.edu>.
   Fixed bug in Date_SetTime (didn't work with $hr,$min,$sec < 10).
   Added ModuloAddition routine and simplified DateCalc.
   Date_TimeZone will now also check `date '+%Z'` suggested by
      Aharon Schkolnik <aharon@healdb.matat.health.gov.il>.

Version 5.06  1996-10-25
   Fixed another two places where a variable was declared twice using my
      (thanks to Ric Steinberger <ric@isl.sri.com>).

   Fixed a bug where "noon" and other special times were not parsed
      in the "which day of month" formats.
   Added "today at time" formats.

   ParseDateDelta now normalizes the delta as well as DateCalc.
   Added %Q format "YYYYMMDD" to UnixDate.  Requested by Rob Perelman
      <robp@electriciti.com>.
   The command "date +%Z" doesn't work on SunOS machines (and perhaps
       others) so 5.05 is effectively broken.  5.06 released to fix this.
       Reported by Rob Perelman <robp@electriciti.com>.

Version 5.07  1996-12-10
   Huge number of code changes to clean things up.
   Added %q format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" to UnixDate.  Requested by Rob Perelman
      <robp@electriciti.com>.  Also added %P format "YYYYMMDDHH:MM:SS".
   Added a new config variable to allow you to work with multiple internal
      formats (with and without colons).  Requested by Rob Perelman
      <robp@electriciti.com>.  See Date_Init documentation.
   Added the following formats suggested by Andreas Johansson
      <Andreas.XS.Johansson@trab.se>:

   Added weeks to ParseDateDelta.  Suggested by Mike Bassman
      <mbassman@fia21-43.fiadev21.lehman.com>.  Note that since
      this is a late addition, I did not change the internal format
      of a delta.  Instead, it is added to the days field.
   Added a new config variable to allow you to define the first day of
      the week.  See Date_Init documentation.
   Added the following formats to ParseDate for conveniance (some were
      suggested by Mike Bassman <mbassman@fia21-43.fiadev21.lehman.com>):
         next/last friday [at time]
         next/last week [at time]
         in 2 weeks [at time]
         2 weeks ago [at time]
         Friday in 2 weeks
         in 2 weeks on friday
         Friday 2 weeks ago
         2 weeks ago friday
   Added Date_SecsSince1970GMT, moved the %s format to %o (secs since 1/1/70)
      and added %s format (secs since 1/1/70 GMT).  Based on suggestions by
      Mark Osbourne <marko@lexis-nexis.com>.  Note this introduces a minor
      backward incompatibility!
   Date_SetTime now works with international time separators.
   Changed how Date_Init arguments work.
   Fixed bug in Date_TimeZone where it didn't recognize +HHMN type time
      zones.  Thanks to Are Bryne <are.bryne@communique.no>.
   Added the %g format (%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z) for an RFC 1123 date.
      Suggested by Are Bryne <are.bryne@communique.no>.
   Added WindowsNT check to Date_TimeZone to get around NT's weird date
      command.  Thanks to Are Bryne <are.bryne@communique.no>.
   Subroutines now check to see if 4 digit years are entered.  Suggested
      by Are Bryne <are.bryne@communique.no>.
   Fixed typo (CSD instead of CST).
   Now reads a config file.
   Added options to delete existing holidays and ignore global config file.
   The d:h:mn:s of ALL deltas are normalized.
   Added local($_) to all routines which use $_.  Suggested by Rob
      Perelman <robp@electriciti.com>.

      time as well as a day.  Suggested by Are Bryne
      <are.bryne@communique.no>.
   Complete rewrite of DateCalc.
   In approximate mode, deltas now come out completely normalized (only 1
      sign).  Suggested by Rob Perelman <robp@electriciti.com>.
   Added business mode.  See documentation.  Suggested by Mike Bassman
      <mbassman@fia21-43.fiadev21.lehman.com>.
   Modified how deltas are normalized and added the DeltaSigns config
      variable.
   Added test suite!
   Fixed sign in military timezones making Date::Manip RFC 1123 compliant
      (except that timezone information is not stored in any format)
   Added Date::Manip::InitDone so initialization isn't duplicated.
   Added a 3rd internal format to store YYYY-MM-DD HH:MN:SS (iso 8601).
   Fixed a bug where UnixDate %E format didn't work with single digit
      dates.  Patch supplied by J\yrgen N\yrgaard <jnp@www.ifs.dk>.
   Added a config variable to allow you to work with 24 hour business
      days.  Suggested by Mike Bassman
      <mbassman@fia21-43.fiadev21.lehman.com>.

      in DateCalc.  Kenneth Ingham <ingham@i-pi.com>
   Restricted timzeones parsing to 0000-2359 instead of 0000-9999.
      Frank Cusack <fcusack@iconnet.net>.
   Added a bit to the Makefile.PL (as it was distributed in the Win32
      Perl Resource Kit).  Murray Nesbitt <murray@ActiveState.com>
   Fixed a German initialization problem.  Thomas Horster-Moller
      <horster-moeller@vivai.de> and Christian Reithmaier
      <reithmaier@04.blf01.telekom400.dbp.de>

Version 5.33  1998-08-20
   Added Spanish support.  Bautista Jasso Javier <jbautist@autrey.com>
   Fixed a bug where "1 month ago" was no longer working (and added it
      to the test cases).  This broke when I fixed the "-1second" bug
      above.  A result of this is that a number of "deltas" can be parsed
      as dates (i.e. &ParseDate("1 hour 20 minutes ago") is equivalent to
      &DateCalc("now","1 hour 20 minutes ago")).  Only text deltas can
      be used in this way (i.e. &ParseDate("-0:0:0:0:1:20:0") will not
      work).

Version 5.34  1999-04-13
   Fixed a bug where a date passed in as an array wasn't getting the
      date removed from the array.  Rick Wise <rwise@lcc.com>
   Added tests for MPE/iX OS.  John Testa <JOHN.TESTA@w-j.com>
   Fixed a bug where WorkDayBeg=8:00 went into an infinite loop.
      Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@nsc.ijs.si>
   A number of typos fixed.  Ron Pero <rpero@boone.net>
   Added exact business mode.  Ian Duplisse <duplisse@rentwks1.golden.csc.com>
   Changed a business week to be the same as an exact week.  Abigal
      <abigail@fnx.com>
   Added Portuguese.  Rui Pedro da Silva Leite Pereira <rui@um.geira.pt>
   *** Switched all variables from Date::Manip::VAR to my(VAR).  This means
      no more access to Date::Manip internals.  Based on suggestion by
      Tom Christiansen <tchrist@jhereg.perl.com>
   Changed %z UnixDate format to return the GMT offset.  TTSG <ttsg@ttsg.com>
   The format "22nd sunday" now returns the real 22nd sunday, NOT the sunday
      of week 22 (based on whatever definition of week 1 is active).
   Fixed a bug where "sunday week 0" didn't work (only affected week 0)
      Gerald Rinske <Gerald.Rinske@mch.sni.de>
   Minor bug (my variable declared twice).  Paul J. Schinder
      <schinder@pobox.com>
   Added "mmmYYYY" and "YYYYmmm" formats.  As a result, "DDYYmmm" and
      "mmmDDYY" formats changed to "DD/YYmmm" and "mmmDD/YY".  David Twomey
      <dtwomey@northernlight.com>
   *** Added Date_Cmp routine.  This will work even after the new internal
      format goes into affect.  Added now in response to a question by
      Al Sorrell <alsorrell@troweprice.com> (I should have added it earlier).
   At the request of the UN, I added the SAT timezone.  :-)  Howard Hendler
      <hendler@un.org>.
   Fixed a bug where "epoch SECONDS" was getting parsed wrong (for SECONDS
      which could be interpreted as an ISO-8601 date).  N. Thomas
      <nthomas@cise.ufl.edu>.
   Fixed a problem where init files were not being read.  Mike Reetz
      <miker@iiug.org>
   Fixed a bug where timezones were converted multiple times if ConvTZ was
      set and DateCalc called.  Steven Hartland <steven_hartland@pa.press.net>

Version 5.35  1999-07-06
   Added Romanian support (including 2 test files).  Iosif Fettich
      <ifettich@netsoft.ro>
   Made "epoch" not case sensitive and fixed a bug where it would fail in
      some languages.  Caught because of Iosif's thorough Romanian test file.
   Fixed a problem where "in 5 days/weeks/months" sometimes wouldn't get
      correctly parsed in other languages.  Caught because of Iosif's
      thorough Romanian test file.
   Fixed a weakness in ParseDateDelta brought out by the Romanian delta test
      file.
   Corrected Swedish translations.  Danne Solli <dsi@xinit.se>
   Documentation updates.
   Modified Date_GetPrev/Date_GetNext to take $curr=2.
   Now parses the Apache log file format "dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss (time zone)".
      Mark Ferguson <Mark.Ferguson@Stanford.EDU>
   Added OS/2 support.  Michael B. Babakov <M.Babakov@tnet.sochi.net>
   Fixed a bug causing warnings in the beta version of perl.  Patch by
      Paul Johnson <pjcj@transeda.com>.
   Some fixes to German translations.  Peter Ehrenberg <pe@dipe.de>
   Deprecated the function Date_DaysSince999.  It's been replaced by
      Date_DaysSince1BC.  It will disappear in the next version.
   Fixed support for years 0000-0999.  Requested by Chris Vaughan
      <chris@lim.com>
   Many changes to recurrences including:
      *** Flags are now supported
      Some bug fixes and documentation changes
      Added test suite
      Added support for Easter (first suggested by Abigal <abigail@fnx.com>)
      Fixed a bug where base/date0/date1 not treated correctly
   Put all the my'ed global variables in a couple hashes to clean up the
      namespace and to make a few future enhancements easier to do.
   Added Italian.  Nicola Pedrozzi <pedrozzi@cscs.ch>
   Added Israel timezones.  Oded Cohen <macman@netvision.net.il>
   Fixed a bug where business weeks weren't being used correctly.  Qian Miao
      <qmiao@ml.com>
   Improved holiday support considerably:
      *** Added support for recurrences and one-year-only holidays (the latter
         requested first by Vishal Bhatia <vishalb@hotmail.com>)
      Cleaned up holiday variables and redid holiday routines.
      Fixed Veteren's day, added Good Friday (off by default).  Peter Chen

#########################################################################
# Backwards incompatibilities
#########################################################################

In 5.07
  %s UnixDate format changed
  By default, the signs of a diff are stored in a different format (only
    minimum number of signs stored).  Backwards compatible if you set
    DeltaSigns=1.
  Date_Init arguments changed (old method supported but depreciated)

In 5.20
  ISO 8601 dates added, several old formats are no longer available
    MM-DD-YY  (conflicts with YY-MM-DD)
    YYMMDD    (conflicts with YYYYMM)
  In keeping with ISO 8601, the weekdays are now numbered 1-7 (mon-sun)
    instead of 0-6 (sun-sat).
  Also for ISO 8601, the week starts with Monday by default.
  By default, the first week of the year contains Jan 4 (ISO 8601).

In 5.21
  Long running process timezone may slip.  See UpdateCurrTZ variable.
  UnixDate formats %W,%U no longer return week 00.  %J is now correct.

In 5.30
  Delta now contains a week field.

In 5.32
  Old style Date_Init arguments no longer supported.
  The DateManip.cnf file's name has changed for ALL non-Unix platforms.

In 5.34
  A business week is now interpreted the same as an exact week.
  *** All Date::Manip variables are declared with my(VAR), so no
    more access to internals.
  %z UnixDate format now returns the timezone as a GMT offset.  %Z still
    returns the abbreviation.
  The format "22nd sunday" now returns the real 22nd sunday, NOT the sunday
    of week 22 (based on whatever definition of week 1 is active).
  "DDYYmmm" and "mmmDDYY" formats changed to "DD/YYmmm" and "mmmDD/YY".
  *** Date_Cmp added in preparation for the change in internal format to
    include the timezone.

In 5.35
  Deprecated the function Date_DaysSince999.  It's been replaced by
    Date_DaysSince1BC.  It will disappear in the next version.
  *** Added the PathSep variable which may cause problems on WinXX platforms
    with old config files where a colon is assumed.
