IO::Socket::SSL is a class implementing an object oriented
interface to SSL sockets. The class is a descendent of
IO::Socket::INET.

In order to use IO::Socket::SSL you need to have Net::SSLeay
v1.08 or newer installed (v1.23 recommended*).  In order to use
password callbacks, Net::SSLeay v1.16 is required.

This version has been tested with a variety of Net::SSLeay
versions (including 1.17-1.23), OpenSSL 0.9.6c-0.9.7b,
and Perl versions 5.005_03, 5.6.0, 5.6.1, and 5.8.0.

In addition to providing a general OO interface to SSL sockets,
this package can be used with libwww-perl.

installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
