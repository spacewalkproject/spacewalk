<h1 align=center>Deadlock detection</h1>
<p>Practically any application that uses locking may deadlock.  The only
exception to this rule is when all the threads of control accessing the
database are read-only or when the Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store product is used; the Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store
product guarantees deadlock-free operation at the expense of reduced
concurrency.
<p>The <a href="../../utility/db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock</a> utility performs deadlock detection by calling
<a href="../../api_c/lock_detect.html">lock_detect</a> at regular intervals; the <a href="../../api_c/lock_detect.html">lock_detect</a> function runs
the Berkeley DB deadlock detector.  When a deadlock exists in the system, all
the threads of control involved in the deadlock are, by definition,
waiting on a lock.  The deadlock detector examines the state of the lock
manager and identifies a deadlock, and selects one of the participants
to abort.  (See <a href="../../ref/lock/config.html">Configuring locking</a>
for a discussion of how a participant is selected).  The
<a href="../../api_c/lock_get.html">lock_get</a> or <a href="../../api_c/lock_vec.html">lock_vec</a> call for which the selected
participant is waiting then returns a <a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a> error.
When using the Berkeley DB access methods, this error return is propagated
back through the Berkeley DB interface to the calling application.
<p>The deadlock detector identifies deadlocks by looking for a cycle in
what is commonly referred to as its "waits-for" graph.  More precisely,
the deadlock detector reads through the lock table, and reviews each
lock object currently locked.  Each object has lockers that currently
hold locks on the object and possibly a list of lockers waiting for a
lock on the object.  Each object's list of waiting lockers defines a
partial ordering.  That is, for a particular object, every waiting
locker comes after every holding locker because that holding locker must
release its lock before the waiting locker can make forward progress.
Conceptually, after each object has been examined, the partial orderings
are topologically sorted.  If this topological sort reveals any cycles,
the lockers forming the cycle are involved in a deadlock.  One of the
lockers is selected for abortion.
<p>It is possible that aborting a single transaction involved in a deadlock
is not enough to allow other transactions to make forward progress.
Unfortunately, at the time a transaction is selected for abortion, there
is not enough information available to determine whether aborting that
single transaction will allow forward progress or not.  Because most
applications have few deadlocks, Berkeley DB takes the conservative approach,
aborting as few transactions as may be necessary to resolve the existing
deadlocks.  In particular, for each unique cycle found in the waits-for
graph described in the previous paragraph, only one transaction is
selected for abortion.  However, if there are multiple cycles, one
transaction from each cycle is selected for abortion.  Only after the
aborting transactions have received the deadlock return and aborted
their transactions can it be determined whether it is necessary to abort
additional transactions in order to allow forward progress.
