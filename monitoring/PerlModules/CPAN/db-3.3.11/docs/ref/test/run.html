<h1 align=center>Running the test suite</h1>
<p>Once you have started tclsh and have loaded the test.tcl source file (see
<a href="../../ref/build_unix/test.html">Running the test suite under UNIX</a>
and <a href="../../ref/build_win/test.html">Running the test suite under
Windows</a> for more information), you are ready to run the test suite.  At
the tclsh prompt, to run the entire test suite, enter the following:
<p><blockquote><pre>% run_std</pre></blockquote>
<p>Running all the tests can take from several hours to a few days to
complete, depending on your hardware.  For this reason, the output from
this command is redirected to a file in the current directory named
<b>ALL.OUT</b>.  Periodically, a line will be written to the standard
output, indicating what test is being run.  When the test suite has
finished, a single message indicating that the test suite completed
successfully or that it failed will be written.  If the run failed, you
should review the file <b>ALL.OUT</b> to determine which tests failed.
Errors will appear in that file as output lines, beginning with the
string "FAIL".
<p>It is also possible to run specific tests or tests for a particular
subsystem:
<p><blockquote><pre>% r archive
% r btree
% r env
% r frecno
% r hash
% r join
% r join
% r lock
% r log
% r mpool
% r mutex
% r queue
% r rbtree
% r recno
% r rrecno
% r subdb
% r txn</pre></blockquote>
<p>Or to run a single, individual test:
<p><blockquote><pre>% test001 btree</pre></blockquote>
<p>It is also possible to modify the test run based on arguments on the
command line.  For example, the following command will run a greatly
abbreviated form of test001, doing 10 operations instead of 10,000:
<p><blockquote><pre>% test001 btree 10</pre></blockquote>
<p>In all cases, when not running the entire test suite as described
previously, a successful test run will return you to the tclsh prompt.
On failure, a message is displayed indicating what failed.
<p>Tests are run, by default, in the directory <b>TESTDIR</b>.  However,
the test files are often very large.  To use a different directory for
the test directory, edit the file include.tcl in your build directory,
and change the following line to a more appropriate value for your
system:
<p><blockquote><pre>set testdir ./TESTDIR</pre></blockquote>
<p>For example, you might change it to the following:
<p><blockquote><pre>set testdir /var/tmp/db.test</pre></blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link named TESTDIR in your
build directory to an appropriate location for running the tests.
Regardless of where you run the tests, the TESTDIR directory should be
on a local filesystem, using a remote filesystem (for example, NFS) will
almost certainly cause spurious test failures.
