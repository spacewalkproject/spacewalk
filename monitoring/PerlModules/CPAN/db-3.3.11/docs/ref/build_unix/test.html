<h1 align=center>Running the test suite under UNIX</h1>
<p>The Berkeley DB test suite is built if you specify --enable-test as an
argument when configuring Berkeley DB.
<p>Before running the tests for the first time, you may need to edit the
<b>include.tcl</b> file in your build directory.  The Berkeley DB
configuration assumes that you intend to use the version of the tclsh
utility included in the Tcl installation with which Berkeley DB was configured
to run the test suite, and further assumes that the test suite will be
run with the libraries prebuilt in the Berkeley DB build directory.  If
either of these assumptions are incorrect, you will need to edit the
<b>include.tcl</b> file and change the following line to correctly
specify the full path to the version of tclsh with which you are going
to run the test suite:
<p><blockquote><pre>set tclsh_path ...</pre></blockquote>
<p>You may also need to change the following line to correctly specify the
path from the directory where you are running the test suite to the
location of the Berkeley DB Tcl API library you built:
<p><blockquote><pre>set test_path ...</pre></blockquote>
<p>It may not be necessary that this be a full path if you have configured
your system's shared library mechanisms to search the directory where
you built or installed the Tcl library.
<p>All Berkeley DB tests are run from within <b>tclsh</b>.  After starting tclsh,
you must source the file <b>test.tcl</b> in the test directory.  For
example, if you built in the <b>build_unix</b> directory of the
distribution, this would be done using the following command:
<p><blockquote><pre>% source ../test/test.tcl</pre></blockquote>
<p>Once you have executed that command and the "%" prompt has returned
without errors, you are ready to run tests in the test suite.
