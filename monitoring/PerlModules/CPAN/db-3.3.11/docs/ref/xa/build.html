<h1 align=center>Building a Global Transaction Manager</h1>
<p>Managing distributed transactions and using the two-phase commit
protocol of Berkeley DB from an application requires the application provide
the functionality of a global transaction manager (GTM).  The GTM is
responsible for the following:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>Communicating with the multiple environments (potentially on separate
systems).
<li>Managing the global transaction ID name space.
<li>Maintaining state information about each distributed transaction.
<li>Recovering from failures of individual environments.
<li>Recovering the global transaction state after failure of the global
transaction manager.
</ul>
<h3>Communicating with multiple Berkeley DB environments</h3>
<p>Two-phase commit is required if an application wants to transaction
protect Berkeley DB calls across multiple environments.  If the environments
reside on the same machine, the application can communicate with each
environment through its own address space with no additional complexity.
If the environments reside on separate machines, the application can
either use the Berkeley DB RPC server to manage the remote environments or it
may use its own messaging capability, translating messages on the remote
machine into calls into the Berkeley DB library (including the recovery
calls).  For some applications, it might be sufficient to use Tcl's
remote invocation to remote copies of the tclsh utility into which the
Berkeley DB library has been dynamically loaded.
<h3>Managing the Global Transaction ID (GID) name space</h3>
<p>A global transaction is a transaction that spans multiple environments.
Each global transaction must have a unique transaction ID.  This unique
ID is the global transaction ID (GID).  In Berkeley DB, global transaction
IDs must be represented with the confines of a <a href="../../api_c/txn_prepare.html#DB_XIDDATASIZE">DB_XIDDATASIZE</a>
size (currently 128 bytes) array.  It is the responsibility of the
global transaction manager to assign GIDs, guarantee their uniqueness,
and manage the mapping of local transactions to GID.  That is, for each
GID, the GTM should know which local transactions managers participated.
The Berkeley DB logging system or a Berkeley DB table could be used to record this
information.
<h3>Maintaining state for each distributed transaction.</h3>
<p>In addition to knowing which local environments participate in each
global transaction, the GTM must also know the state of each active
global transaction.  As soon as a transaction becomes distributed (that
is, a second environment participates), the GTM must record the
existence of the global transaction and all participants (whether this
must reside on stable storage or not depends on the exact configuration
of the system).  As new environments participate, the GTM must keep this
information up to date.
<p>When the GTM is ready to begin commit processing, it should issue
<a href="../../api_c/txn_prepare.html">txn_prepare</a> calls to each participating environment, indicating
the GID of the global transaction.  Once all the participants have
successfully prepared, then the GTM must record that the global
transaction will be committed.   This record should go to stable
storage.  Once written to stable storage, the GTM can send
<a href="../../api_c/txn_commit.html">txn_commit</a> requests to each participating environment.  Once
all environments have successfully completed the commit, the GTM can
either record the successful commit or can somehow "forget" the global
transaction.
<p>If nested transactions are used (that is, the <b>parent</b> parameter
is specified to <a href="../../api_c/txn_begin.html">txn_begin</a>), no <a href="../../api_c/txn_prepare.html">txn_prepare</a> call should
be made on behalf of any child transaction.  Only the ultimate parent
should even issue a <a href="../../api_c/txn_prepare.html">txn_prepare</a>.
<p>Should any participant fail to prepare, then the GTM must abort the
global transaction.  The fact that the transaction is going to be
aborted should be written to stable storage.  Once written, the GTM can
then issue <a href="../../api_c/txn_abort.html">txn_abort</a> requests to each environment.  When all
aborts have returned successfully, the GTM can either record the
successful abort or "forget" the global transaction.
<p>In summary, for each transaction, the GTM must maintain the following:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>A list of participating environments
<li>The current state of each transaction (pre-prepare, preparing,
committing, aborting, done)
</ul>
<h3>Recovering from the failure of a single environment</h3>
<p>If a single environment fails, there is no need to bring down or recover
other environments (the only exception to this is if all environments
are managed in the same application address space and there is a risk
that the failure of the environment corrupted other environments).
Instead, once the failing environment comes back up, it should be
recovered (that is, conventional recovery, via <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> or by
specifying the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a> flag to <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> should be
run).
If the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility is used, then the -e option must be
specified.  In this case, the application will almost certainly want
to specify environmental parameters via a DB_CONFIG file in the
environment's home directory, so that <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> can create
an appropriately configured environment.
If the <a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> utility is not used, then <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a>
should not be specified, unless all processing including recovery, calls
to <a href="../../api_c/txn_recover.html">txn_recover</a>, and calls to finish prepared, but not yet
complete transactions take place using the same database environment
handle.
The GTM should then issue a <a href="../../api_c/txn_recover.html">txn_recover</a> call to the environment.
This call will return a list of prepared, but not yet committed or
aborted transactions.  For each transaction, the GTM should look up the
GID in its local store to determine if the transaction should commit or
abort.
If the GTM is running in a system with multiple GTMs, it is possible that
some of the transactions returned via <a href="../../api_c/txn_recover.html">txn_recover</a> do not belong
to the current environment.  The GTM should detect this and call
<a href="../../api_c/txn_discard.html">txn_discard</a> on each such transaction handle.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the environment does not
retain information about which GTM has issued <a href="../../api_c/txn_recover.html">txn_recover</a>
operations.  Therefore, each GTM should issue all its <a href="../../api_c/txn_recover.html">txn_recover</a>
calls, before another GTM issues its calls.  If the calls are interleaved,
each GTM may not get a complete and consistent set of transactions.
The simplest way to enforce this is for each GTM to make sure it can
receive all its outstanding transactions in a single <a href="../../api_c/txn_recover.html">txn_recover</a>
call.  The maximum number of possible outstanding transactions is bounded
by the maximum number of active transactions in the environment.  This
number can be obtained by using the <a href="../../api_c/txn_stat.html">txn_stat</a> interface or the
<a href="../../utility/db_stat.html">db_stat</a> utility.
<p>The newly recovered environment will forbid any new transactions from
being started until the prepared but not yet committed/aborted
transactions have been resolved.  In the multiple GTM case, this means
that all GTMs must recover before any GTM can begin issuing new transactions.
<p>Because Berkeley DB flushed both commit and abort records to disk for
two-phase transaction, once the global transaction has either committed
or aborted, no action will be necessary in any environment.  If local
environments are running with the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_TXN_NOSYNC">DB_TXN_NOSYNC</a> option (that
is, is not writing the log synchronously at commit time), then it is
possible that a commit or abort operation may not have been written in
the environment.  In this case, the GTM must always have a record of
completed transactions to determine if prepared transactions should be
committed or aborted.
<h3>Recovering from GTM failure</h3>
<p>If the GTM fails, it must first recover its local state.  Assuming the
GTM uses Berkeley DB tables to maintain state, it should run
<a href="../../utility/db_recover.html">db_recover</a> (or the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a> option to
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a>) upon startup.  Once the GTM is back up and running,
it needs to review all its outstanding global transactions, that is all
transaction which are recorded, but not yet committed or aborted.
<p>Any global transactions which have not yet reached the prepare phase
should be aborted.  If these transactions were on remote systems, the
remote systems should eventually time them out and abort them.  If these
transactions are on the local system, we assume they crashed and were
aborted as part of GTM startup.
<p>The GTM must then identify all environments which need to have their
<a href="../../api_c/txn_recover.html">txn_recover</a> interface called.  This includes all environments
that participate in any transaction that is in the preparing, aborting,
or committing state.  For each environment, the GTM should issue a
<a href="../../api_c/txn_recover.html">txn_recover</a> call.  Once each environment has responded, the GTM
can determine the fate of each transaction.  The correct behavior is
defined depending on the state of the global transaction according to
the table below.
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>preparing<dd>if all participating environments return the transaction in the prepared
but not yet committed/aborted state, then the GTM should commit the
transaction.  If any participating environment fails to return it, then
the GTM should issue an abort to all environments that did return it.
<p><dt>committing<dd>the GTM should send a commit to any environment that returned this
transaction in its list of prepared but not yet committed/aborted
transactions.
<p><dt>aborting<dd>the GTM should send an abort to any environment that returned this
transaction in its list of prepared but not yet committed/aborted
transactions.
