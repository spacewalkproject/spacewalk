<h1 align=center>Repeatable reads</h1>
<p>The fourth reason listed for using transactions was <i>repeatable
reads</i>.  A repeatable read simply means that, for the life of the
transaction, every time a request is made by any thread of control to
read a data item, it will be unchanged from its previous value; that
is, that the value will not change until the transaction commits or
aborts.
<p>Most applications do not need to enclose reads in transactions, and when
possible, transactionally protected reads should be avoided, as they
often cause performance problems.  The problem is that a transactionally
protected cursor, reading each key/data pair in a database, will acquire
a read lock on most of the pages in the database and so will gradually
block all write operations on the databases until the transaction
commits or aborts.  Note, however, that if there are update transactions
present in the application, the read operations must still use locking,
and should be prepared to repeat any operation (possibly closing and
reopening a cursor) that fails with a return value of
<a href="../../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK">DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</a>.  The exceptions to this rule are when the
application is doing a read-modify-write operation and so requires
atomicity, and when an application requires the ability to repeatedly
access a data item knowing that it will not have changed.
<p>Berkeley DB optionally supports reading uncommitted data; that is, read
operations may request data which has been modified but not yet
committed by another transaction.  This is done by first specifying the
<a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_DIRTY_READ">DB_DIRTY_READ</a> flag when opening the underlying database, and
then specifying the <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_DIRTY_READ">DB_DIRTY_READ</a> flag when beginning a
transaction, opening a cursor, or performing a read operation.  The
advantage of using <a href="../../api_c/db_open.html#DB_DIRTY_READ">DB_DIRTY_READ</a> is that read operations will
not block when another transaction holds a write lock on the requested
data; the disadvantage is that read operations may return data that will
disappear should the transaction holding the write lock abort.
