<h1 align=center>Application structure</h1>
<p>When building transactionally protected applications, there are some
special issues that must be considered.  The most important one is that
if any thread of control exits for any reason while holding Berkeley DB
resources, recovery must be performed to do the following:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>Recover the Berkeley DB resources.
<li>Release any locks or mutexes that may have been held to avoid starvation
as the remaining threads of control convoy behind the failed thread's
locks.
<li>Clean up any partially completed operations that may have left a
database in an inconsistent or corrupted state.
</ul>
<p>Complicating this problem is the fact that the Berkeley DB library itself
cannot determine whether recovery is required; the application itself
<b>must</b> make that decision.  A further complication is that
recovery must be single-threaded; that is, one thread of control or
process must perform recovery before any other thread of control or
processes attempts to create or join the Berkeley DB environment.
<p>There are two approaches to handling this problem:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>The hard way:<dd>An application can track its own state carefully enough that it knows
when recovery needs to be performed.  Specifically, the rule to use is
that recovery must be performed before using a Berkeley DB environment any
time the threads of control previously using the Berkeley DB environment did
not shut the environment down cleanly before exiting the environment
for any reason (including application or system failure).
<p>Requirements for shutting down the environment cleanly differ, depending
on the type of environment created.  If the environment is public and
persistent (that is, the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag was not specified to
the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> function), recovery must be performed if any transaction
was not committed or aborted, or <a href="../../api_c/env_close.html">DB_ENV-&gt;close</a> function was not called
for any open DB_ENV handle.
<p>If the environment is private and temporary (that is, the
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_PRIVATE">DB_PRIVATE</a> flag was specified to the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> function),
recovery must be performed if any transaction was not committed or
aborted, or <a href="../../api_c/env_close.html">DB_ENV-&gt;close</a> function was not called for any open
DB_ENV handle.  In addition, at least one transaction checkpoint
must be performed after all existing transactions have been committed
or aborted.
<p><dt>The easy way:<dd>It greatly simplifies matters that recovery may be performed regardless
of whether recovery strictly needs to be performed; that is, it is not
an error to run recovery on a database for which no recovery is
necessary.  Because of this fact, it is almost invariably simpler to
ignore the previous rules about shutting an application down cleanly,
and simply run recovery each time a thread of control accessing a
database environment fails for any reason, as well as before accessing
any database environment after system reboot.
</dl>
<p>There are two common ways to build transactionally protected Berkeley DB
applications.  The most common way is as a single, usually
multithreaded, process.  This architecture is simplest because it
requires no monitoring of other threads of control.  When the
application starts, it opens and potentially creates the environment,
runs recovery (whether it was needed or not), and then opens its
databases.  From then on, the application can create new threads of
control as it chooses.  All threads of control share the open Berkeley DB
DB_ENV and DB handles.  In this model, databases are
rarely opened or closed when more than a single thread of control is
running; that is, they are opened when only a single thread is running,
and closed after all threads but one have exited.  The last thread of
control to exit closes the databases and the environment.
<p>An alternative way to build Berkeley DB applications is as a set of
cooperating processes, which may or may not be multithreaded.  This
architecture is more complicated.
<p>First, this architecture requires that the order in which threads of
control are created and subsequently access the Berkeley DB environment be
controlled because recovery must be single-threaded.  The first thread
of control to access the environment must run recovery, and no other
thread should attempt to access the environment until recovery is
complete.  (Note that this ordering requirement does not apply to
environment creation without recovery.  If multiple threads attempt to
create a Berkeley DB environment, only one will perform the creation and the
others will join the already existing environment.)
<p>Second, this architecture requires that threads of control be monitored.
If any thread of control that owns Berkeley DB resources exits without first
cleanly discarding those resources, recovery is usually necessary.
Before running recovery, all threads using the Berkeley DB environment must
relinquish all of their Berkeley DB resources (it does not matter if they do
so gracefully or because they are forced to exit).  Then, recovery can
be run and the threads of control continued or restarted.
<p>We have found that the safest way to structure groups of cooperating
processes is to first create a single process (often a shell script)
that opens/creates the Berkeley DB environment and runs recovery, and that
then creates the processes or threads that will actually perform work.
The initial thread has no further responsibilities other than to monitor
the threads of control it has created, to ensure that none of them
unexpectedly exits.  If one exits, the initial process then forces all
of the threads of control using the Berkeley DB environment to exit, runs
recovery, and restarts the working threads of control.
<p>If it is not practical to have a single parent for the processes sharing
a Berkeley DB environment, each process sharing the environment should log
their connection to and exit from the environment in a way that allows
a monitoring process to detect if a thread of control might have
acquired Berkeley DB resources and never released them.  In this model, an
initial "watcher" process opens/creates the Berkeley DB environment and runs
recovery, and then creates a sentinel file.  Any other process wanting
to use the Berkeley DB environment checks for the sentinel file; if the
sentinel file exists, the other process registers its process ID with
the watcher and joins the database environment.  When the other process
finishes with the environment, it unregisters its process ID with the
water.  The watcher periodically checks to ensure that no process has
failed while using the environment.  If a process does fail while using
the environment, the watcher removes the sentinel file, kills all
processes currently using the environment, runs recovery, and re-creates
the sentinel file.
<p>Obviously, it is important that the monitoring process in either case
be as simple and well-tested as possible because there is no recourse
if it fails.
