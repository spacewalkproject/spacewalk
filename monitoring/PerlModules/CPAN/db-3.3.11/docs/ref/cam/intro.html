<h1 align=center>Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store applications</h1>
<p>It is often desirable to have concurrent read-write access to a database
when there is no need for full recoverability or transaction semantics.
For this class of applications, Berkeley DB provides an interface supporting
deadlock-free, multiple-reader/single writer access to the database.
This means that at any instant in time, there may be either multiple
readers accessing data or a single writer modifying data.  The
application is entirely unaware of which is happening, and Berkeley DB
implements the necessary locking and blocking to ensure this behavior.
<p>To create Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store applications, you must first initialize an environment
by calling <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a>.  You must specify the <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_CDB">DB_INIT_CDB</a>
and <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_MPOOL">DB_INIT_MPOOL</a> flags to that interface.  It is an error to
specify any of the other <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a> subsystem or recovery
configuration flags, for example, <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_LOCK">DB_INIT_LOCK</a>,
<a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_TXN">DB_INIT_TXN</a>, or <a href="../../api_c/env_open.html#DB_RECOVER">DB_RECOVER</a>.  All databases must, of
course, be created in this environment by using the <a href="../../api_c/db_create.html">db_create</a>
interface or <a href="../../api_cxx/db_class.html">Db</a> constructor, and specifying the environment
as an argument.
<p>Berkeley DB performs appropriate locking in its interface so that safe
enforcement of the deadlock-free, multiple-reader/single-writer semantic
is transparent to the application.  However, a basic understanding of
Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store locking behavior is helpful when writing Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store applications.
<p>Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store
avoids deadlocks without the need for a deadlock detector by performing
all locking on an entire database at once (or on an entire environment
in the case of the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_flags.html#DB_CDB_ALLDB">DB_CDB_ALLDB</a> flag), and by ensuring that at
any given time only one thread of control is allowed to simultaneously
hold a read (shared) lock and attempt to acquire a write (exclusive)
lock.
<p>All open Berkeley DB cursors hold a read lock, which serves as a guarantee
that the database will not change beneath them;  likewise, all
non-cursor <a href="../../api_c/db_get.html">DB-&gt;get</a> operations temporarily acquire and release
a read lock that is held during the actual traversal of the database.
Because read locks will not conflict with each other, any number of
cursors in any number of threads of control may be open simultaneously,
and any number of <a href="../../api_c/db_get.html">DB-&gt;get</a> operations may be concurrently in
progress.
<p>To enforce the rule that only one thread of control at a time can
attempt to upgrade a read lock to a write lock, however, Berkeley DB must
forbid multiple cursors from attempting to write concurrently.  This is
done using the <a href="../../api_c/db_cursor.html#DB_WRITECURSOR">DB_WRITECURSOR</a> flag to the <a href="../../api_c/db_cursor.html">DB-&gt;cursor</a>
interface.  This is the only difference between access method calls in
Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store and in the other Berkeley DB products.  The <a href="../../api_c/db_cursor.html#DB_WRITECURSOR">DB_WRITECURSOR</a> flag
causes the newly created cursor to be a "write" cursor; that is, a
cursor capable of performing writes as well as reads.  Only cursors thus
created are permitted to perform write operations (either deletes or
puts), and only one such cursor can exist at any given time.
<p>Any attempt to create a second write cursor or to perform a non-cursor
write operation while a write cursor is open will block until that write
cursor is closed.  Read cursors may open and perform reads without blocking
while a write cursor is extant.  However, any attempts to actually perform
a write, either using the write cursor or directly using the
<a href="../../api_c/db_put.html">DB-&gt;put</a> or <a href="../../api_c/db_del.html">DB-&gt;del</a> methods, will block until all read cursors
are closed.  This is how the multiple-reader/single-writer semantic is
enforced, and prevents reads from seeing an inconsistent database state
that may be an intermediate stage of a write operation.
<p>With these behaviors, Berkeley DB can guarantee deadlock-free concurrent
database access, so that multiple threads of control are free to perform
reads and writes without needing to handle synchronization themselves
or having to run a deadlock detector.  Because Berkeley DB has no knowledge
of which cursors belong to which threads, however, some care must be
taken to ensure that applications do not inadvertently block themselves,
causing the application to hang and be unable to proceed.  Some common
mistakes include the following:
<p><ol>
<p><li>Keeping a cursor open while issuing a <a href="../../api_c/db_put.html">DB-&gt;put</a> or <a href="../../api_c/db_del.html">DB-&gt;del</a>
access method call.
<p><li>Attempting to open a write cursor while a write cursor is already being
held open by the same thread of control.  Note that it is correct
operation for one thread of control to attempt to open a write cursor
or to perform a non-cursor write (<a href="../../api_c/db_put.html">DB-&gt;put</a> or <a href="../../api_c/db_del.html">DB-&gt;del</a>)
while a write cursor is already active in another thread.  It is only
a problem if these things are done within a single thread of control --
in which case that thread will block and never be able to release the
lock that is blocking it.
<p><li>Keeping a write cursor open for an extended period of time.
<p><li>Not testing Berkeley DB error return codes (if any cursor operation returns
an unexpected error, that cursor must still be closed).
<p><li>By default, Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store does locking on a per-database basis.  For this reason,
accessing multiple databases in different orders in different threads
or processes, or leaving cursors open on one database while accessing
another database, can cause an application to hang.  If this behavior
is a requirement for the application, Berkeley DB should be configured to do
locking on an environment-wide basis.  See the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_flags.html#DB_CDB_ALLDB">DB_CDB_ALLDB</a> flag
of the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_flags.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_flags</a> function for more information.
