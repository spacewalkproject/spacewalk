<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This manual page describes the specific details of the Dbt class,
used to encode keys and data items in a database.
<a name="3"><!--meow--></a>
<h3>Key/Data Pairs</h3>
<p>Storage and retrieval for the Db access methods are based on
key/data pairs.  Both key and data items are represented by Dbt
objects.  Key and data byte strings may refer to strings of zero length
up to strings of essentially unlimited length.  See
<a href="../ref/am_misc/dbsizes.html">Database limits</a> for more
information.
<p>The Dbt class provides simple access to an underlying data
structure, whose elements can be examined or changed using the
<b>set_</b> or <b>get_</b> methods.  The remainder of the manual
page sometimes refers to these accesses using the underlying name; for
example, <b>ulen</b> rather than Dbt::get_ulen and
Dbt::set_ulen.  Dbt can be subclassed, providing a way
to associate with it additional data or references to other
structures.
<p>The constructors set all elements of the underlying structure to zero.
The constructor with two arguments has the effect of setting all elements
to zero except for the <b>data</b> and <b>size</b> elements.
<p>In the case in which the <b>flags</b> structure element is set to 0, when
the application is providing Berkeley DB a key or data item to store into the
database, Berkeley DB expects the <b>data</b> object to point to a byte
string of <b>size</b> bytes.  When returning a key/data item to the
application, Berkeley DB will store into the <b>data</b> object a pointer to
a byte string of <b>size</b> bytes, and the memory to which the pointer
refers will be allocated and managed by Berkeley DB.
<p>The elements of the structure underlying the Dbt class are defined as follows:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>void *<a name="data">data</a>;<dd>A pointer to a byte string.
This element is accessed using Dbt::get_data and
Dbt::set_data, and may be initialized using one
of the constructors.
<p><dt>u_int32_t size;<dd>The length of <b>data</b>, in bytes.
This element is accessed using Dbt::get_size and
Dbt::set_size, and may be initialized
using the constructor with two arguments.
<p><dt>u_int32_t ulen;<dd>The size of the user's buffer (referred to by <b>data</b>), in bytes.
This location is not written by the Db methods.
<p>Note that applications can determine the length of a record by setting
the <b>ulen</b> to 0 and checking the return value found in <b>size</b>.
See the DB_DBT_USERMEM flag for more information.
<p>This element is accessed using
Dbt::get_ulen and Dbt::set_ulen.
<p><dt>u_int32_t dlen;<dd>The length of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.
See the DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
This element is accessed using
Dbt::get_dlen, and Dbt::set_dlen.
<p><dt>u_int32_t doff;<dd>The offset of the partial record being read or written by the application,
in bytes.
See the DB_DBT_PARTIAL flag for more information.
This element is accessed using
Dbt::get_doff and Dbt::set_doff.
<p><dt>u_int32_t flags;<dd>This element is accessed using Dbt::get_flags and
Dbt::set_flags.
<p>The <b>flags</b> value must be set to 0 or by bitwise inclusively <b>OR</b>'ing together one or
more of the following values:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_DBT_MALLOC">DB_DBT_MALLOC</a><dd>When this flag is set, Berkeley DB will allocate memory for the returned key
or data item
(using <b>malloc</b>(3) or the user-specified malloc method), and
return a pointer to it in the <b>data</b> field of the key or data
Dbt object.  Because any allocated memory becomes the
responsibility of the calling application, the caller must determine
whether memory was allocated using the returned value of the
<b>data</b> field.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of DB_DBT_MALLOC,
DB_DBT_REALLOC, and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<p><dt><a name="DB_DBT_REALLOC">DB_DBT_REALLOC</a><dd>When this flag is set Berkeley DB
will allocate memory for the returned key or data item (using
<b>realloc</b>(3) or the user-specified realloc method), and return
a pointer to it in the <b>data</b> field of the key or data Dbt
object.  Because any allocated memory becomes the responsibility of the
calling application, the caller must determine whether memory was
allocated using the returned value of the <b>data</b> field.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of DB_DBT_MALLOC,
DB_DBT_REALLOC, and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
<p><dt><a name="DB_DBT_USERMEM">DB_DBT_USERMEM</a><dd>The <b>data</b> field of the key or data object must refer to memory
that is at least <b>ulen</b> bytes in length.  If the length of the
requested item is less than or equal to that number of bytes, the item
is copied into the memory referred to by the <b>data</b> field.
Otherwise, the <b>size</b> field is set to the length needed for the
requested item, and the error ENOMEM is returned.
<p>It is an error to specify more than one of DB_DBT_MALLOC,
DB_DBT_REALLOC, and DB_DBT_USERMEM.
</dl>
<p>If DB_DBT_MALLOC or DB_DBT_REALLOC is specified, Berkeley DB
allocates a properly sized byte array to contain the data.  This can be
convenient if you know little about the nature of the data, specifically
the size of data in the database.  However, if your application makes
repeated calls to retrieve keys or data, you may notice increased garbage
collection due to this allocation.  If you know the maximum size of data
you are retrieving, you might decrease the memory burden and speed your
application by allocating your own byte array and using
DB_DBT_USERMEM.  Even if you don't know the maximum size, you can
use this option and reallocate your array whenever your retrieval API call
returns an ENOMEM error or throws an exception encapsulating an ENOMEM.
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_DBT_PARTIAL">DB_DBT_PARTIAL</a><dd>Do partial retrieval or storage of an item.  If the calling application
is doing a get, the <b>dlen</b> bytes starting <b>doff</b> bytes from
the beginning of the retrieved data record are returned as if they
comprised the entire record.  If any or all of the specified bytes do
not exist in the record, the get is successful, and any existing bytes
are returned.
<p>For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial retrieval was done using a Dbt having a <b>dlen</b>
field of 20 and a <b>doff</b> field of 85, the get call would succeed,
the <b>data</b> field would refer to the last 15 bytes of the record,
and the <b>size</b> field would be set to 15.
<p>If the calling application is doing a put, the <b>dlen</b> bytes starting
<b>doff</b> bytes from the beginning of the specified key's data record
are replaced by the data specified by the <b>data</b> and <b>size</b>
objects.
If <b>dlen</b> is smaller than <b>size</b>, the record will grow; if
<b>dlen</b> is larger than <b>size</b>, the record will shrink.
If the specified bytes do not exist, the record will be extended using nul
bytes as necessary, and the put call will succeed.
<p>It is an error to attempt a partial put using the <a href="../api_cxx/db_put.html">Db::put</a>
method in a database that supports duplicate records.
Partial puts in databases supporting duplicate records must be done
using a <a href="../api_cxx/dbc_class.html">Dbc</a> method.
<p>It is an error to attempt a partial put with differing <b>dlen</b> and
<b>size</b> values in Queue or Recno databases with fixed-length records.
<p>For example, if the data portion of a retrieved record was 100 bytes,
and a partial put was done using a Dbt having a <b>dlen</b>
field of 20, a <b>doff</b> field of 85, and a <b>size</b> field of 30,
the resulting record would be 115 bytes in length, where the last 30
bytes would be those specified by the put call.
</dl>
</dl>
<p>Each Dbt object has an associated DBT struct, which is used by
the underlying implementation of Berkeley DB and its C-language API.  The
Dbt::get_DBT method returns a pointer to this struct.  Given a const
Dbt object, Dbt::get_const_DBT returns a const pointer to the
same struct.
<p>Given a DBT struct, the Dbt::get_Dbt method returns the corresponding
Dbt object, if there is one.  If the DBT object was not
associated with a Dbt (that is, it was not returned from a call
to Dbt::get_DBT), then the result of Dbt::get_Dbt is undefined.  Given
a const DBT struct, Dbt::get_const_Dbt returns the associated const
Dbt object, if there is one.
<p>These methods may be useful for Berkeley DB applications including  both C
and C++ language software.  It should not be necessary to use these
calls in a purely C++ application.
