=head1 NAME

monitoring-data-cleanup - Delete unused and old data from monitoring probes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

monitoring-data-cleanup [OPTIONS]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script deletes data from monitoring probes older than given time frame.
It can be useful to run from cron to periodically delete data which is not 
interesting for you.

Additionally - in Spacewalk 0.5 and older we did not deletes data when probe
has been deleted. And if you did not push scout configs you will be getting
data for deleted probes too. This script will delete them too.

=head1 OPTIONS

--dry-run
        No changes will be committed. All data will remain intact.

--delete-unmatched
        Delete data from probes, which have been already deleted. This is default.

--no-delete-unmatched
        Do not delete data from probes, which have been already deleted. Default is to delete them.

--keep-monitoring-data DELTA
        Delete data older than DELTA. Recognized deltas are of the form:
             +Yy +Mm +Ww +Dd +Hh +MNmn +Ss
        Examples:
                "1year 2 months 3hours"
                "2 business days"
        For more information about format see ParseDateDelta section of Date::Manip(3)

--interval INTERVAL_DELTA
       If set, delete data older than DELTA in increments of
       INTERVAL_DELTA, starting with the oldest record.
       Example:
             monitoring-data-cleanup --keep-monitoring-data "1 month" --interval "1 month"
       This is used to delete large amounts of monitoring data without encountering error
       ORA-30036 or requiring an enormous undo tablespace.

--help
        Display this help.
