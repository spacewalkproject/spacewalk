" \n"
" Red Hat has self-certified as adhering to the European Union \"safe\n"

" Our website sometimes requires you to give us personal information\n"
" when you do things like purchase products in our Web store or\n"
" register your products with redhat.com.  Red Hat uses your personal\n"
" information only for marketing, customer service, delivery of\n"

" situations such as these, you will be given a choice as to whether\n"

" a product or service that requires your immediate attention.  For\n"
" your protection, we may contact you via phone or email as the\n"
" situation warrants.\n"
" \n"
" Also, our website sometimes requires you to give us personal\n"
" information in order to do things like access webcasts, download\n"
" whitepapers, or participate in online surveys.  In situations like\n"
" these, where you are accessing free products and services from Red\n"
" Hat and/or our business partners, we recognize your interest in the\n"
" product or service and consider that  to be \"opting in\" to allow Red\n"
" Hat and appropriate business partners to contact you with\n"

" \n"
" \n"
" Information Collected On Red Hat Network\n"
" \n"
" If you register your system on Red Hat Network, you will be asked to\n"
" provide a system profile when you register. The system profile\n"
" consists of:\n"
" \n"
" 1) An inventory of the .rpm files installed on the system. This\n"
" information helps determine what new software updates may be\n"
" valuable to you in keeping your system secure and available.\n"
" \n"
" 2) An inventory of your system hardware. This information is also\n"
" used by Red Hat to determine what software and support information\n"
" might be useful to you.\n"
" \n"
" You can determine the information in your System Profile prior to\n"
" registering it on Red Hat Network by typing the following at the\n"
" command prompt:\n"
" \n"
" $rhn_register\n"
" \n"
" This command will start the registration program, and all of the\n"
" information contained in the system profile is presented to you for\n"
" review prior to submission to Red Hat.\n"
" \n"
" Once you have registered a system profile, you can browse and edit\n"
" your profile information from your Red Hat Network page.\n"
" \n"
" When requested by you with a command from Red Hat Network, certain\n"
" application configuration information about a particular system may\n"
" be provided to Red Hat and displayed to you in a Web page to assist\n"
" you in configuring your system. At your request, Red Hat may store\n"
" this information for a time to assist you in system recovery should\n"
" you make a mistake in the application configuration. In each case\n"
" where configuration information is stored by Red Hat, it will be at\n"
" your request and only for a period of time sufficient to confirm\n"
" acceptance of new configuration settings.\n"
" \n"
" Other than the System Profile and application configuration you\n"
" request as part of an online service, Red Hat will never retrieve or\n"
" store personal file information from your system as part of any Red\n"
" Hat service.\n"
" \n"
" \n"
" Information Collected in Other Ways\n"
" \n"
" We collect information in other ways, such as running contests on\n"
" our site and at trade shows, in which we ask you for contact\n"
" information (like your email address), unique identifiers (like your\n"
" password), and demographic information (like your occupation).  We\n"
" may use data from these contests and trade shows to contact you or\n"
" to allow appropriate business partners to contact you.  If you do\n"
" not wish to be contacted, we ask that you refrain from participating\n"
" in these promotions.\n"
" \n"

" Our site automatically captures IP addresses.  We use IP addresses\n"
" to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our\n"

" with third-party data.  Also, Red Hat discloses aggregated user\n"
" statistics in order to describe our services to current and\n"
" prospective partners and other third parties.  Red Hat has\n"
