Unbreakable Linux Network integration for Spacewalk
===================================================

This package contains the ULN plugin for the existing spacewalk-repo-sync
utility. The plugin allows you to synchronize ULN channels directly into Spacewalk 
channels without requiring the Spacewalk server to be registered to ULN.

Configuration of the plugin
---------------------------

The plugin only requires very basic configuration via the /etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/uln.conf file. 

[main]
username = <ULN SSO username>
password = <ULN SSO password>

As this file contains login credentials for the Unbreakable Linux Network, we strongly recommend ensuring
read-only access to the user that will run spacewalk-repo-sync by setting file permissions to 0400.

The plugin can also use any proxy configured via /etc/rhn/rhn.conf or the Spacewalk web interface.

Configuration of Spacewalk
--------------------------

The plugin extends the functionality of spacewalk-repo-sync by allowing it to download packages and errata
directly from ULN into an existing Spacewalk Software Channel. The configuration procedure is:

1. Create a Spacewalk channel
2. Run spacewalk-repo-sync to sync packages and errata (if available) from ULN into that channel.

It is not necessarily to create a Repository in Spacewalk.

Usage instructions
------------------

This example assumes you have created a Software Channel in Spacewalk with the Channel Label 
of oraclelinux6_x86_64_latest and you want to sync the packages and errata from the ULN channel with the
label of ol6_x86_64_latest into this Software Channel.

You will need to know the channel label of the Spacewalk Software Channel as well as the channel label of the
upstream ULN channel you want to synchronize from.

From a command prompt, run:

# spacewalk-repo-sync --type uln --channel=oraclelinux6_x86_64_latest --url=uln:///ol6_x86_64_latest

The command-line parameters are:

-c CHANNEL_LABEL, --channel=CHANNEL_LABEL
    The label of the Spacewalk channel to sync packages to

-u URL, --url=URL
    The url to sync. ULN channels are specified as uln:///<channel_label>. Note there are three / characters in the URL.

-t REPO_TYPE, --type=REPO_TYPE
     The type of repo. To use direct ULN integration, set this to "uln".

You can also set the -q or --quiet parameter when running via a cronjob. It is recommended that a cronjob be manually 
configured to run this script at least once a day to keep the Spacewalk channels up-to-date with ULN. This script is
not currently integrated with the Spacewalk task engine and cannot be scheduled via the Spacewalk web interface.
