<h1><rhn-icon type="header-info" title="information"/> About <pxt-config var="product_name"/></h1>

    <p>
<pxt-config var="product_name"/> allows administrators to efficiently manage the systems on their
network. Through a simple user interface, administrators can perform patch
management, updates, monitoring, and maintenance. And because <pxt-config var="product_name"/> is Web-based,
it can be accessed from anywhere. <pxt-config var="product_name"/> or Proxy server options provide
advanced capabilities and the ability to get updates directly from Red Hat with
even greater levels of security and reduced network bandwidth.
    </p>

  <h2>Modules</h2>
    <p>
      <pxt-config var="product_name"/> currently offers three modules. Customers can purchase entitlements that allow their systems to be subscribed to the modules and receive <pxt-config var="product_name"/> services and functionality. <a href="http://www.redhat.com/software/rhn/purchase/">Learn more</a>.
    </p>

  <div class="marketing-summary">
  <h3>Update Module</h3>
    <p>
Complimentary with a subscription to RHEL, the Update Module allows you to easily install new updates to your system, receive priority errata notifications, ensure RPM dependency checking, and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhn/rhndetails/update/">more</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="marketing-summary">

    <p>

  <h2>Architectures</h2>

    <p>
<pxt-config var="product_name"/> has three types of architecture:
    </p>

  <div class="marketing-summary">
  <h3>Hosted model</h3>
    <p>
The customer's indivdual systems connect with RHN via the internet and exchange packages and information with the central RHN servers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="marketing-summary">
  <h3>Proxy model</h3>
    <p>
The customer's individual systems connect to a locally hosted (on the customer network) <pxt-config var="product_name"/> Proxy. The Proxy aggregates all necessary data and performs some tasks locally, and also communicates via the internet with the central <pxt-config var="product_name"/> servers. All information stored in the <pxt-config var="product_name"/> database is kept on the <pxt-config var="product_name"/> servers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="marketing-summary">
  <h3><pxt-config var="product_name"/> model</h3>
    <p>
All <pxt-config var="product_name"/> functionality (system profiles, reporting data, application server, etc.) is stored locally on the customers network. The <pxt-config var="product_name"/> Server connects with <pxt-config var="product_name"/> over the internet only to download updates (other update methods are available). This model provides customers with the ability to take their <pxt-config var="product_name"/> solution off the public internet if desired, and also allows for greater optimization and control of your systems.
