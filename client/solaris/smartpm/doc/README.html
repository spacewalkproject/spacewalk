<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" name="overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>Smart Package Manager</strong> project has the ambitious objective of
creating smart and portable algorithms for solving adequately the
problem of managing software upgrading and installation. This tool
works in all major distributions, and will bring notable advantages
over native tools currently in use (APT, APT-RPM, YUM, URPMI, etc).</p>
<p>From <cite>The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing</cite>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
smart

    1. &lt;programming&gt; Said of a program that does the {Right Thing}
    in a wide variety of complicated circumstances. (...)

<div class="section" id="project-status">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" name="project-status">Project Status</a></h1>
<p>The development of Smart Package Manager started on May 4th, 2004, and
the project is currently under beta testing, since all core features
are implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" name="features">Features</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="modular">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" name="modular">Modular</a></h2>
<p>Smart has been developed with modularity and flexibility in mind. It's
completely backend-based, and package-manager-agnostic. Support is
currently implemented for <strong>RPM</strong>, <strong>DPKG</strong>, and <strong>Slackware</strong>
package management systems, and porting it to new systems should be
very easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="smart-transactions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" name="smart-transactions">Smart Transactions</a></h2>
<p>That's one of the most interesting aspects of Smart Package Manager,
and the one who has motivated calling it <cite>smart</cite>. Computing
transactions respecting the relations involved in the package
management world may become an unpleasant task when thousands of
packages and relations are being considered, or even when just
a few complex relations turn the most obvious choice into the
unwanted one.</p>
<p>While other softwares try to find a possible solution to satisfy
the relations involved in some user-requested operation, and
sometimes even fail to do so <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1" name="id1">[1]</a>, Smart goes beyond it. In the
kernel of Smart Package Manager lives an algorithm that will
not only find a solution, if one is available, but will find
the best solution. This is done by quickly weighting every
possible solution with a pluggable policy, which redefines
the term &quot;best&quot; depending on the operation goal (install,
remove, upgrade, etc).</p>
<p>This behavior has many interesting consequences. In upgrades,
for instance, while precedence is given to newer versions,
intermediate versions may get selected if they result in a
better global result for the system. Packages may even be
reinstalled, if different packages with the same name-version
pair have different relations, and the one not installed
is a considered better option.</p>
<p>Another important goal achieved with the transaction algorithm
is that, even though it is able to check and fix relations in
the whole system, it will work even when there are broken
relations in installed packages. Only relations related to
the operation being made is checked for correctness.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-interfaces">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" name="multiple-interfaces">Multiple Interfaces</a></h2>
<p>Smart has multiple native and completely integrated interfaces:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Command line interface, with several useful subcommands: update,
install, reinstall, upgrade, remove, check, fix, download, search,
and more.</li>
<li>Shell interface, with command and argument completion, making it
easy to perform multiple operations quickly using a local or
remote terminal.</li>
<li>Graphic interface, offering the friendliness of visual
user interaction.</li>
<li>Command line interface with graphic feedback, allowing one to
integrate the power of command line with graphic environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these interfaces, ksmarttray is also included in the smart
package. It notifies users about available updates using a KDE
tray icon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="channels">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" name="channels">Channels</a></h2>
<p>Channels are the way Smart becomes aware about external repositories
of information. Many different channel types are supported, depending
on the backend and kind of information desired:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>APT-DEB Repository</li>
<li>APT-RPM Repository</li>
<li>DPKG Installed Packages</li>
<li>Mirror Information</li>
<li>Red Carpet Channel</li>
<li>RPM Directory</li>
<li>RPM Header List</li>
<li>RPM MetaData (YUM)</li>
<li>RPM Installed Packages</li>
<li>Slackware Repository</li>
<li>Slackware Installed Packages</li>
<li>URPMI Repository</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="priority-handling">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10" name="priority-handling">Priority Handling</a></h2>
<p>Priorities are a powerful way to easily handle integration
of multiple channels and explicit user setups regarding
preferred package versions.</p>
<p>Basically, packages with higher priorities are considered a
better option to be installed in the system, even when package
versions state otherwise. Priorities may be individually
assigned to all packages in given channels, to all packages
with given names, and to packages with given names inside
given channels.</p>
<p>With custom priority setups, it becomes possible to avoid
unwanted upgrades, force downgrades, select packages in given
channels as preferential, and other kinds of interesting setups.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="autobalancing-mirror-system">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11" name="autobalancing-mirror-system">Autobalancing Mirror System</a></h2>
<p>Smart offers a very flexible mirror support. Mirrors are URLs
that supposedly provide the same contents as are available in
other URLs, named origins. There is no internal restriction on
the kind of information which is mirrored. Once an origin URL
is provided, and one or more mirror URLs are provided, these
mirrors will be considered for any file which is going to be
fetched from an URL starting with the origin URL.</p>
<p>Mirror precedence is dynamically computed based on the history
of downloads of all mirrors available for a given origin URL
(including the origin site itself). The fastest mirrors and
with less errors are chosen. When errors occur, the next
mirror in the queue is tried.</p>
<p>For instance, if a mirror <cite>http://mirror.url/path/</cite> is provided
for the origin <cite>ftp://origin.url/other/path/</cite>, and a file in
<cite>ftp://origin.url/other/path/subpath/somefile</cite> is going to be
fetched, the mirror will be considered for being used, and the
URL <cite>http://mirror.url/path/subpath/somefile</cite> will be used if
the mirror is chosen. Notice that strings are compared and
replaced without any pre-processing, so that it's possible to
use different schemes (ftp, http, etc) in mirror entries, and
even URLs ending in prefixes of directory entries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="downloading-mechanism">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12" name="downloading-mechanism">Downloading Mechanism</a></h2>
<p>Smart has a fast parallel downloading mechanism, allowing multiple
connections to be used for one or more sites. The mechanism
supports:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Resuming</li>
<li>Timestamp checking</li>
<li>Parallel uncompression</li>
<li>Autodetection of FTP user limit</li>
<li>Cached file validation</li>
</ul>
<p>and more.</p>
<p>At that moment, the following schemes are nativelly supported:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>file</li>
<li>ftp</li>
<li>http</li>
<li>https</li>
<li>scp</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the following schemes are supported when pycurl is
available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ftps</li>
<li>telnet</li>
<li>dict</li>
<li>ldap</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="removable-media-support">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13" name="removable-media-support">Removable Media Support</a></h2>
<p>Smart Package Manager implements builtin support for removable media
(CDROMs, DVDs, etc) in most of the supported channel types. The
following features are currently implemented:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mountpoint autodetection</li>
<li>Support for multiple simultaneous media drives</li>
<li>Medias may be inserted in any order</li>
<li>Installed system is guaranted to maintain correct relations
between media changes</li>
<li>Remote removable media support using any of the supported schemes
(ftp, http, scp, etc)</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section" id="running-smart">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14" name="running-smart">Running Smart</a></h1>
<p>Smart Package Manager may be run in many different ways, depending
on the interface in use and on the intended goal.</p>
<p>The following command would install the <cite>foobar</cite> package, for instance:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
smart install foobar
</pre>
<p>While the following command would install the <cite>foobar</cite> package, but with
graphic output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
smart --gui install foobar
</pre>
<p>To open the graphic interface in interactive mode, one may simply run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
smart --gui
</pre>
<p>Similarly, the following command would open the shell interface:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
smart --shell
</pre>
<p>Extensive help is available for all commands, by using the <cite>--help</cite>
switch:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>In this section will be described real cases showing <cite>Smart</cite> behavior
in comparison with other tools, or handling unusual situations.</p>
<p>Notice that Smart was not tunned to work in any of these cases, and
the reason it works is because handling unusual situations was the
initial project goal.</p>
<div class="section" id="case-1-apt">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18" name="case-1-apt">Case 1 - APT</a></h2>
<p>This case happened in a real world environment where a weakness in
the algorithm used by <cite>APT</cite> (which is the same used in <cite>APT-RPM</cite>)
turned a simple operation into a problem of obscure results.
Smart Package Manager was used in the same environment to show
its results.</p>
<p>The problem starts when an installation of <cite>xscreensaver</cite> is tried:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[root&#64;damien:/root] apt-get install xscreensaver

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  xscreensaver: Depends: libglade-2.0.so.0
                Depends: libxml2.so.2
E: Broken packages
</pre>
<p>The error shown makes the user belive that <cite>libglade-2.0.so.0</cite> and
<cite>libxml2.so.2</cite> are not available. That's not the case:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

<p>Another misguiding error message. Let's go further:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

Building Dependency Tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  glibc-iconv: Depends: glibc-gconvdata (= 2.3.3) but 1:2.3.2-586_1cl is to be installed
E: Broken packages
</pre>
<p>Version <cite>2.3.3</cite> is needed, but <cite>1:2.3.2-586_1cl</cite> is to be installed. This
message is mostly correct. The only problem is, &quot;1:2.3.2-586_1cl&quot; is
already installed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[root&#64;damien:/root] apt-cache policy glibc-gconvdata
glibc-gconvdata:

     0:2.3.3-69473cl 0

</pre>
<p>The problem was found. A package from another repository (586_1cl shows
it's not native, in that specific case) has a higher epoch than the one
available in the usual repository. This clearly shows that the APT
algorithm marks a single version as candidate, and when this is not the
wanted version for some operation, the whole operation is compromised.</p>
<p>When testing <cite>Smart Package Manager</cite> in the same environment, the
expected result is obtained:</p>

<div class="section" id="case-2-apt-yum">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19" name="case-2-apt-yum">Case 2 - APT &amp; YUM</a></h2>
<p>This is another real case, and is being reproduced in a controlled
environment for tests with YUM, APT-RPM, and Smart.</p>
<p>The issue is, a package named <cite>A</cite> requires package <cite>BCD</cite> explicitly, and
RPM detects implicit dependencies between <cite>A</cite> and <cite>libB</cite>, <cite>libC</cite>, and <cite>libD</cite>.
Package <cite>BCD</cite> provides <cite>libB</cite>, <cite>libC</cite>, and <cite>libD</cite>, but additionally there
is a package <cite>B</cite> providing <cite>libB</cite>, a package <cite>C</cite> providing <cite>libC</cite>, and
a package <cite>D</cite> providing <cite>libD</cite>.</p>
<p>In other words, there's a package <cite>A</cite> which requires four different symbols,
and one of these symbols is provided by a single package <cite>BCD</cite>, which happens
to provide all symbols needed by <cite>A</cite>. There are also packages <cite>B</cite>, <cite>C</cite>, and <cite>D</cite>,
that provide some of the symbols required by <cite>A</cite>, but can't satisfy all
dependencies without <cite>BCD</cite>.</p>
<p>The expected behavior for an operation asking to install <cite>A</cite> is obviously
selecting <cite>BCD</cite> to satisfy <cite>A</cite>'s dependencies, on the other hand, <cite>YUM</cite> and
APT fail to deliver that as a guaranted operation, as is shown
below.</p>
<p>First, let's see how YUM deals with the problem:</p>

<p>YUM selected <strong>all</strong> packages for installation, even though <cite>BCD</cite>

<p>Smart correctly selected only <cite>BCD</cite>, since it's necessary anyway, and
solves all dependencies.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20" name="case-3-apt-yum">Case 3 - APT &amp; YUM</a></h2>
<p>That's another interesting case which was tested with APT-RPM and YUM.</p>
<p>In this case, there's a package <cite>A</cite> version 1.0 installed in the
system, and there are two versions available for upgrading: 1.5 and 2.0.
Version 1.5 may be installed without problems, but version 2.0 has a
dependency on <cite>B</cite>, which is not available anywhere.</p>
<p>In this case, the best possibility is upgrading to 1.5, since upgrading
to 2.0 is not an option.</p>
<p>Let's see how APT reacts to this situation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[root&#64;burma ~]% apt-get upgrade A
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
The following packages have been kept back
  A
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 removed and 1 not upgraded.
</pre>
<p>APT seems to refuse to upgrade <cite>A</cite>, even though version 1.5 might be
installed without problems.</p>
<p>What happens when forcing APT to install <cite>A</cite>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[root&#64;burma ~]% apt-get install A
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  A: Depends: B but it is not installable
E: Broken packages
</pre>
<p>It really refuses to install the newest version, and doesn't consider
the possibility of using version 1.5.</p>
<p>Now, let's see how YUM would handle it.</p>

present the missing dependency. I apologise for showing invalid
results.</td>

<p>Just like APT, YUM selected version 2.0 and didn't consider the
availability of an intermediate version.</p>
<p>Now, let's see how Smart would behave in the same situation:</p>

<div class="section" id="case-4-apt">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21" name="case-4-apt">Case 4 - APT</a></h2>
<p>This case presents the following situation: there's a package <cite>A</cite>,
installed in the system, which depends on <cite>libfoo</cite>, currently
being provided by <cite>B</cite> 1.0. What happens if <cite>B</cite> is upgraded to
version 2.0, but <cite>libfoo</cite> is moved to be provided by package <cite>C</cite>?</p>
<p>The expected behavior would be to upgrade <cite>B</cite> to version 2.0,
and install <cite>C</cite> to satisfy <cite>A</cite>'s dependency.</p>
<p>That's not what happens with APT:</p>
