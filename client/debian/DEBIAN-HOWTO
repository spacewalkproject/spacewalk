HOW TO BUILD DEBIAN PACKAGES

The client packages are built using debbuild.

The following packages make up the client stack:
* apt-spacewalk (in client/debian)
* rhn-client-tools (in client/tools)
* rhnlib (in client/rhel)
* rhnsd (in client/rhel)
* rhncfg (in client/tools)
* spacewalk-usix (in usix)

The following external packages are also part of the client stack:
* python-dmidecode (in client/debian)
* python-hwdata (in client/debian)

Preparation steps:

1. Install debbuild from https://github.com/ascherer/debbuild/releases

2. Create the debbuild package build tree

mkdir -p ~/debbuild/{SPECS,SOURCES,SDEBS,DEBS,BUILD,BUILDROOT}

To build the non-external packages, these are the following steps:

1. Switch to the directory of the package source (ex. for apt-spacewalk, cd client/debian/apt-spacewalk)

2. Use tito to build tarball (tito build --tgz)

3. Copy the tarball to ~/debbuild/SOURCES and spec to ~/debbuild/SPECS

4. Change to ~/debbuild/SPECS and run "debbuild -ba" on the spec. (ex. for apt-spacewalk, debbuild -ba apt-spacewalk.spec)

For external packages, the only difference is step 2, where you use spectool to fetch the tarball instead.
For example, for python-hwdata, "spectool -g python-hwdata.spec" is sufficient to get the sources.


How to regenerate repo:
-----------------------
cd spacewalk/debian
dpkg-scanpackages  dists/spacewalk-unstable/binary-amd64 |gzip >dists/spacewalk-unstable/binary-amd64/Packages.gz
dpkg-scanpackages  dists/spacewalk-unstable/binary-i386 |gzip >dists/spacewalk-unstable/binary-i386/Packages.gz
