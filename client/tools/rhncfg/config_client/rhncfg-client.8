.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The RHN Configuration Client (\fBrhncfg-client\fR) is used to query a
system's configuration makeup and deployment status as managed by RHN.
.PP
This tool enables an Red Hat Network client to \fBlist\fR available
configuration files, fetch (or \fBget\fR) those
configuration files, \fBview\fR configuration channels, and
finally, \fBdiff\fR and \fBverify\fR current
configuration of the system in comparison to the system's status according
to RHN.
.PP

This tool utilizes a "cvs style" command syntax: command mode options

For example: rhncfg-client diff --topdir /home/test/blah/

option. E.g., rhncfg-client diff --topdir /home/test/foo/
