.SH NAME
rhnsd \- A program for querying the Spacewalk server for updates and information.

.SH SYNOPSIS

rhn_check [\fIoptions\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
\fBrhnsd\fR is a background daemon process that periodically
polls the Spacewalk server to see if there are any queued actions
available. If any are queued, rhnsd will execute those actions. 
.PP
rhnsd is typically started from the initialization (init) scripts in 
\fI/etc/init.d/rhnsd\fP.
when it's time to poll the Spacewalk server for available
updates and actions. The default interval is every 240 minutes. 
The minimum polling interval is 60 minutes. 
.PP
To check for updates, rhnsd runs an external program called 
\fBrhn_check\fR. This is a small application that actually
makes the network connection to Spacewalk. 
.PP
The rhnsd daemon does not listen on any network ports, nor
does it ever talk to the network directly. Any network
activity is done via the \fBrhn_check\fR utility. 
.PP
rhnsd can be configured by editing the
\fI/etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnsd\fP. 
configuration file. This is actually the
configuration file the rhnsd initialization script
\fI/etc/init.d/rhnsd\fP.
uses.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-i\fR, \fB--interval\fR"
Specify the interval that rhnsd should wait between
checking the Spacewalk. Default is 240 minutes,
the minimum is 60 minutes. This can also be specified
in \fI/etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnsd\fP
.br
.IP "\fB-f\fR, \fB--foreground\fR"
force the rhnsd process to run in the foreground instead
of automatically backgrounding itself, as it does by default.

.SH FILES

.IP \fI/etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnsd\fP
Configuration settings for the rhnsd daemon's initialization script.
