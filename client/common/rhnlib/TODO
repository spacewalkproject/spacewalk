- Check nonblocking support for HTTPS as well.
- Allow for multi-valued headers
- Wrapper around the socket class, to allow for calling select() on the socket
  I/O
- Split this module intelligently
- Build an __init__ file to expose the desired API
- Fix the Input and Output objects: setting the encoding from the input object
  to the output object is difficult (there is a patch somewhere for this, I'll
  have to look it up -- misa)
- Clean up things
- More documentation
- Check compliance with python 1.5
- Figure out a better way to pass the client version
- Figure out what the version we pass in the headers should look like.
- Finish the TODO :-)
