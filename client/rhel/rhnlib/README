0. HISTORY

Traditionally, rhn used a patched version of Fredrik Lundh's xmlrpclib, 
shipped with Red Hat 6.2, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 in a package called 
python-xmlrpc.

The additions included improved transport objects (proxy support, a 
better SSL framework, encodings and transfers), most of them part of a module
called cgiwrap.

Since python 2.2 (and previous python 2 releases) ships Fredrik Lundh's
xmlrpclib as a standard library, maintaining a patched version of xmlrpclib
was no longer feasible. SSL support in python 2.2 is also hopelessly
incomplete, so using an external module seems to be a better approach. We
chose pyOpenSSL instead of m2crypto, partly because swig seems to change
rather quickly.

rhnlib tries to reuse as much as possible from the old cgiwrap, as well as
from what the standard python libraries provide.
