Create channel to update level
 	by Justin Sherrill (jsherril@redhat.com)

This script can create a channel to a specific update level (i.e. RHEL4u3) or upgrade an existing channel to a higher update level on an RHN Satellite or Spacewalk server.

For help, simply run ./create-channel-update --help


Examples
-------

Create channel 'my-stable-channel' for RHEL 4 AS u3 i386:
./create-channel-update  -l admin -s myserver.example.com -v 4 -u u3 -r AS -a i386   -d my-stable-channel

or another way:
./create-channel-update  -l admin -s myserver.example.com  -D ./data/4-U3-AS-i386  -d my-stable-channel

Upgrade prevously created channel 'my-stable-channel' to RHEL 4 AS u4 i386: 
./create-channel-update  -l admin -s myserver.example.com -v 4 -u u4 -r AS -a i386   -d my-stable-channel

Add the extra's channel as a child channel of 'my-stable-channel':
./create-channel-update  -l admin -s myserver.example.com -v 4 -u u4 -r AS -a i386 -e extras  -p my-stable-channel


Skip List
---------

If you would like to create a channel at a specific version with the exception of certain packages (kernel, bash, etc..)
   simply create a file ('skiplist.txt') and with the names of the packages such as:

kernel
kernel-smp
bash

then simply pass the  '--skiplist=skiplist.txt' option when running the command.  All packages from the specified release will
	be copied to the channel except for those in the skip list.


In addition to the script, you should find in this directory:
data/   - Data files for all of the update releases.
README  - This file
